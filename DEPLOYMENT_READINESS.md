## Outstanding Items (Optional - P2/P3)

These are non-blocking quality improvements identified during code review:

### P2 Items (Medium Priority)
1. **Complete Type Hints**: Add type hints to helper functions
2. **Request ID in Logs**: Include request_id in all error logs
3. **Entity Conversion Error Handling**: Improve specificity
4. **Deprecated Code Comments**: Update main.py and extract.py

### P3 Items (Low Priority - Technical Debt)
1. **Legacy Health Check Code**: Mark Local Llama code as deprecated
2. **Standardize Log Formatting**: Use f-strings consistently
3. **Add Pagination**: Implement for /patterns/detailed endpoint

**Estimated Effort**: 8.5 hours (1 working day)  
**Impact**: Code quality improvement from 88/100 to 95+/100
