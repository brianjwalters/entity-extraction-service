## üéØ Quick Reference

### Current Performance Status

```
Performance Tier:    B-Tier
Avg Execution Time:  50.66s
Extraction Rate:     0.232 entities/sec
Quality Score:       95.2% confidence

Target (Phase 1):    A-Tier (<35s, >0.35 entities/sec)
Target (Phase 2):    S-Tier (<25s, >0.55 entities/sec)
```

### Key Findings

1. ‚úÖ **Quality Maintained:** No correlation between speed and confidence (r=-0.047)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Strategy Bottleneck:** three_wave is 324% slower than single_pass
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Document Size Impact:** Strong correlation (r=0.983) between size and time
4. üéØ **Optimization Potential:** 80-100% performance improvement achievable

### Immediate Recommendations

**Priority 1: Critical (Immediate)**
1. Deprecate three_wave strategy (31% performance gain)
2. Implement document size gating (>10k tokens)
3. Optimize single_pass pattern matching (20-30% improvement)

**Priority 2: High Value (4-6 weeks)**
4. Sliding window extraction (40-50% reduction in token processing)
5. Parallel entity type extraction (30-40% throughput increase)
6. Smart caching layer (20-30% speedup for repeated patterns)

**Priority 3: Advanced (Future)**
7. GPU-accelerated processing (2-3x throughput)
8. Incremental stream processing (50-70% latency reduction)

## üîÑ Updating the Analysis

To regenerate the performance analysis with new test data:

1. Ensure `test_history.json` contains updated test results
2. Run the analysis script: `python analyze_performance.py`
3. Review updated `performance_analysis.md` report
4. Manually update insights and summary if needed

**Note:** The script automatically overwrites `performance_analysis.md` but preserves `PERFORMANCE_INSIGHTS.md` and `PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.md` as they contain manual strategic analysis.
