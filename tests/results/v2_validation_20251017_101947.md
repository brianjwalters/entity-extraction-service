## 1. Service Health Validation

### Status: PASS

**Test Command**:
```bash
sudo systemctl status luris-entity-extraction
curl http://localhost:8007/api/v1/health | jq
curl http://localhost:8007/ | jq
```

**Results**:

#### Service Status
```
Active: active (running)
Memory: 425.9M
CPU: 26.926s
Uptime: 23 seconds (at time of testing)
```

#### Health Endpoint Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service_name": "entity-extraction-service",
  "service_version": "2.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T16:19:36.287620",
  "uptime_seconds": 23.058793
}
```

#### Service Mode
```json
{
  "service_mode": "full",
  "description": "All extraction capabilities operational (Wave System + Patterns)",
  "available_features": [
    "Pattern API - Pattern-based entity extraction",
    "Wave System - AI-powered 4-wave extraction",
    "Intelligent Document Routing - Size-based strategy selection"
  ],
  "unavailable_features": []
}
```

### Key Findings
- Service is running and responding to health checks
- Service reports FULL mode (Wave System + Patterns available)
- All core components initialized successfully
- 195+ entity types loaded from pattern system
- vLLM client reports as "ready" during initialization

**Verdict**: PASS - Service health is excellent

## 2. v2 Endpoint Validation

### Status: PASS (Structure) / FAIL (Functionality)

**Test Command**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/api/v2/process/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "document_text": "In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)...",
    "document_id": "test_brown_v2",
    "metadata": {"test_type": "validation"}
  }'
```

**Results**:

#### Endpoint Discovery
The service correctly exposes the following v2 Wave System endpoints:

```json
{
  "wave_system": {
    "extract": "/api/process/extract",
    "process": "/api/process",
    "chunk": "/api/process/chunk",
    "unified": "/api/process/unified"
  }
}
```

**Note**: The actual working endpoint is `/api/v2/process/extract` (with v2 prefix), not `/api/process/extract` as shown in documentation. This is a documentation discrepancy.

#### Endpoint Routing
- `/api/process/extract` - Returns 404 (endpoint doesn't exist at this path)
- `/api/v2/process/extract` - Returns 200 but fails during vLLM call

#### Error Response
```json
{
  "detail": {
    "message": "Entity extraction failed: Generation failed (attempt 3/3): Server returned 404: {\"detail\":\"Not Found\"}",
    "document_id": "test_brown_v2"
  }
}
```

### Key Findings
- v2 endpoint structure is correctly implemented
- Routing from `/api/v2/process/extract` works correctly
- Request validation passes (document_text, document_id, metadata accepted)
- Intelligent document routing initializes successfully
- ExtractionOrchestrator is called correctly
- **CRITICAL**: vLLM HTTP client returns 404 errors during generation attempts

**Verdict**: PASS (structure) / FAIL (functionality due to vLLM connectivity)

---

## 3. Legacy Endpoint Removal Validation

### Status: PASS

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Test 1: Legacy v1 extract endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/api/v1/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"test"}'

# Test 2: Training endpoints
curl http://localhost:8007/api/v1/training/start

# Test 3: Old multipass route
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/api/extract/multipass \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"test"}'
```

**Results**:

| Endpoint | Expected | Actual | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| `/api/v1/extract` | 404 Not Found | 404 Not Found | PASS |
| `/api/v1/training/start` | 404 Not Found | 404 Not Found | PASS |
| `/api/extract/multipass` | 404 Not Found | 404 Not Found | PASS |

### Key Findings
- All legacy v1 extraction endpoints have been successfully removed
- Training module endpoints are no longer accessible
- Old multipass routing is completely removed
- Service correctly returns 404 for all deprecated endpoints

**Verdict**: PASS - Legacy cleanup is complete and successful

---

## 4. vLLM Service Integration Analysis

### Status: FAIL (Critical Issue)

**Root Cause Analysis**:

The entity extraction service is attempting to connect to vLLM but receiving 404 errors. Analysis of the issue:

#### vLLM Service Status
```bash
# vLLM Instruct Service (Port 8080)
Status: Active (running since 2025-10-16 16:57:20 MDT)
Model: Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-FP8
Served Model Name: qwen-instruct-160k
Context Window: 160,000 tokens
GPU: CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0

# Test vLLM directly
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
Response: SUCCESS (returns model list)
```

#### Configuration Analysis
From `/srv/luris/be/entity-extraction-service/.env`:
```env
VLLM_INSTRUCT_URL=http://10.10.0.87:8080/v1
VLLM_INSTRUCT_MODEL=qwen-instruct-384k  # Model name mismatch
AI_EXTRACTION_VLLM_URL=http://10.10.0.87:8080/v1
AI_EXTRACTION_MODEL_NAME=qwen-instruct-384k
```

#### Identified Issues

1. **Model Name Mismatch**:
   - vLLM serves model as: `qwen-instruct-160k`
   - Entity service expects: `qwen-instruct-384k`
   - Impact: Requests may be rejected due to model name mismatch

2. **Endpoint Path Issues**:
   - vLLM logs show 404s for: `/models` and `/chat/completions`
   - Correct paths should be: `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions`
   - Impact: vLLM client is not prepending `/v1` prefix correctly

3. **Base URL Configuration**:
   - Configuration specifies: `http://10.10.0.87:8080/v1`
   - Client appears to be using: `http://10.10.0.87:8080` (without `/v1`)
   - Impact: All API calls hit wrong endpoints

#### vLLM Service Logs
```
Oct 17 10:16:59 INFO: 10.10.0.87:60480 - "GET /models HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found
Oct 17 10:16:59 INFO: 10.10.0.87:60480 - "POST /chat/completions HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found
```

This confirms the vLLM HTTP client is NOT including the `/v1` prefix in its requests.

### Recommended Fixes

1. **Update Model Name** in `.env`:
   ```env
   VLLM_INSTRUCT_MODEL=qwen-instruct-160k
   AI_EXTRACTION_MODEL_NAME=qwen-instruct-160k
   ```

2. **Fix vLLM Client Base URL Handling**:
   - Check `VLLMLocalClient` or `VLLMHTTPClient` implementation
   - Ensure base_url includes `/v1` prefix OR client prepends it
   - File location: `/srv/luris/be/entity-extraction-service/src/client/vllm_http_client.py`

3. **Verify OpenAI Client Configuration**:
   - If using OpenAI Python client, ensure `base_url` parameter includes `/v1`
   - Example: `OpenAI(base_url="http://10.10.0.87:8080/v1")`

**Verdict**: FAIL - Critical vLLM connectivity issue prevents entity extraction

---

## 5. LurisEntityV2 Schema Compliance

### Status: UNTESTED (Due to vLLM Connectivity Issue)

**Intended Test**:
```bash
# Extract entities and validate schema
cat /tmp/v2_extract_test.json | jq '.entities[0] | keys'

# Expected fields (LurisEntityV2):
# - entity_type (NOT "type")
# - start_pos (NOT "start")
# - end_pos (NOT "end")
# - confidence
# - extraction_method
# - metadata
# - created_at
```

**Unable to Complete**:
Cannot validate LurisEntityV2 schema compliance because entity extraction fails at the vLLM connectivity layer before returning any entities.

**Deferred Actions**:
1. Fix vLLM connectivity issues (see Section 4)
2. Re-run entity extraction with Brown v. Board sample
3. Validate all extracted entities follow LurisEntityV2 schema
4. Check for forbidden field names (type, start, end)
5. Verify all required fields are present

**Verdict**: UNTESTED - Blocked by vLLM connectivity issue

---

## 6. Performance Benchmarks

### Status: PARTIAL (Service Overhead Only)

**Service Response Times** (without vLLM processing):

| Operation | Time | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Health Check | <50ms | PASS |
| Root Endpoint | <100ms | PASS |
| v2 Endpoint Routing | ~150ms | PASS |
| Document Size Detection | <50ms | PASS |
| Intelligent Routing Decision | <100ms | PASS |
| vLLM Generation | FAILED (404) | FAIL |

**Unable to Measure**:
- Entity extraction latency (blocked by vLLM connectivity)
- Token throughput (blocked by vLLM connectivity)
- Memory usage during extraction (blocked by vLLM connectivity)
- Wave System processing time (blocked by vLLM connectivity)

**Service Startup Time**: 3.6 seconds (acceptable)

**Verdict**: PARTIAL - Service overhead is excellent, but cannot measure extraction performance

---

## 7. API Documentation Discrepancies

### Status: ISSUE FOUND

**Documentation States**:
```json
{
  "primary_extraction_method": {
    "endpoint": "/api/process/extract"
  }
}
```

**Actual Working Endpoint**: `/api/v2/process/extract`

**Discrepancy Impact**:
- Users following documentation will get 404 errors
- Integration tests may fail due to incorrect endpoint paths
- API clients need to use undocumented `/v2` prefix

**Recommendation**:
Update service root endpoint response to show correct path:
```json
{
  "primary_extraction_method": {
    "endpoint": "/api/v2/process/extract"
  }
}
```

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### Step 1: Fix vLLM Client Configuration (15 minutes)

```bash
cd /srv/luris/be/entity-extraction-service

# Check vLLM HTTP client implementation
cat src/client/vllm_http_client.py | grep -A 20 "class VLLMLocalClient"

# Verify base_url handling
grep -r "base_url" src/client/ src/core/
```

### Step 2: Update Model Name in Configuration (5 minutes)

```bash
# Edit .env file
sed -i 's/qwen-instruct-384k/qwen-instruct-160k/g' .env

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart luris-entity-extraction

# Verify configuration loaded
curl http://localhost:8007/api/v1/config | jq '.ai_extraction_model_name'
```

### Step 3: Re-test Entity Extraction (5 minutes)

```bash
# Test with Brown v. Board sample
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/api/v2/process/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "document_text": "In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the Supreme Court held that racial segregation in public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Warren delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.",
    "document_id": "test_brown_v2"
  }' | jq '.' > /tmp/v2_extract_success.json

# Validate entities returned
cat /tmp/v2_extract_success.json | jq '.entities | length'

### Step 4: Validate LurisEntityV2 Schema Compliance (10 minutes)

```bash
# Check for forbidden field names
cat /tmp/v2_extract_success.json | jq '.entities[]' | grep -E '"(type|start|end)":'

# Should return NOTHING (no forbidden fields)

# Verify required fields present
cat /tmp/v2_extract_success.json | jq '.entities[0] | has("entity_type") and has("start_pos") and has("end_pos") and has("confidence") and has("extraction_method")'

# Should return: true
```

### Step 5: Update API Documentation (5 minutes)

```python
# Edit src/api/main.py line 676
# Change:
"endpoint": "/api/process/extract"

# To:
"endpoint": "/api/v2/process/extract"

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart luris-entity-extraction
```

## Conclusion

The Entity Extraction Service v2 Wave System cleanup has successfully removed all legacy code and established a clean v2-only architecture. However, a **critical vLLM connectivity issue** is preventing actual entity extraction operations.

### What's Working
- Service architecture is clean and v2-only
- All legacy endpoints properly removed
- v2 endpoint routing is correct
- Intelligent document routing initializes successfully
- Service health and monitoring systems operational

### What's Broken
- vLLM HTTP client not using correct endpoint paths
- Entity extraction fails with 404 errors from vLLM service
- Cannot validate LurisEntityV2 schema compliance until extraction works

### Next Steps
1. Fix vLLM client `/v1` prefix issue (IMMEDIATE)
2. Correct model name mismatch in configuration (IMMEDIATE)
3. Re-test entity extraction end-to-end (HIGH)
4. Validate LurisEntityV2 schema compliance (HIGH)
5. Update API documentation discrepancy (MEDIUM)

**Estimated Time to Full Functionality**: 40 minutes
