   - Best overall quality
   - 191 entities, 93.5% coverage
   - 0.917 avg confidence

2. **combined_hybrid** - Score: 66.12
   - Best balance
   - 130 entities, 87.1% coverage
   - 0.887 avg confidence

3. **extraction_ai_enhanced** - Score: 64.66

   - 151 entities, 74.2% coverage
   - 0.902 avg confidence

4. **extraction_nlp_spacy** - Score: 61.65
   - Good baseline
   - 128 entities, 74.2% coverage
   - 0.866 avg confidence

5. **extraction_regex** - Score: 59.19
   - Fastest processing
   - 111 entities, 80.7% coverage
   - 0.753 avg confidence

### Visual Quality Metrics

#### Entity Type Coverage
- **Fully Covered**: 14 types (found by all strategies)
- **Partially Covered**: 17 types (found by some)
- **Not Covered**: 0 types (all types found by at least one strategy)

#### Confidence Distributions
| Strategy | High (>0.9) | Medium (0.7-0.9) | Low (<0.7) |
|----------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| specialized_legal | 70% | 26% | 4% |
| ai_enhanced | 53% | 40% | 7% |
| hybrid | 46% | 46% | 8% |
| nlp_spacy | 38% | 47% | 15% |
| regex | 0% | 66% | 34% |

#### Processing Efficiency
- **Fastest**: regex @ 77.6 entities/second
- **Most Accurate**: specialized @ 0.917 confidence
- **Best Coverage**: specialized @ 93.5% entity types
- **Most Balanced**: hybrid @ optimal trade-offs

## Visual Inspection Capabilities

### Entity Comparisons
The reports show actual extracted entities, not just statistics:
- Justice names with confidence scores
- Case citations with Bluebook formatting
- Constitutional provisions identified
- Legal doctrines and holdings

### Quality Heatmaps
Visual indicators show at-a-glance quality:
- ðŸŸ¢ Excellent performance
- ðŸŸ¡ Good performance
- ðŸŸ  Fair performance
- ðŸ”´ Poor performance

### Coverage Matrices
Entity type coverage displayed as:
- â–ˆ High density (>20 occurrences)
- â–“ Medium density (10-20)
- â–’ Low density (5-10)
- â–‘ Minimal (1-5)
- Â· Not found

## Recommendations Based on Visual Analysis

### Use Case Selection
1. **Legal Research**: Use specialized_legal for maximum quality
2. **High Volume**: Use regex for speed (7x faster)
3. **Production**: Use hybrid for balance
4. **Development**: Use nlp_spacy as baseline

### Quality Improvements Identified
- Regex needs expanded patterns for better confidence
- NLP benefits from legal domain fine-tuning
- AI enhanced could optimize prompts for speed
- Specialized achieves best quality but needs caching
