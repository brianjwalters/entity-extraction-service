Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nSyllabus\nDOBBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE\nMISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, ET AL. v.\nJACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION ET AL.\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\nNo. 19\u20131392. Argued December 1, 2021\u2014Decided June 24, 2022\nMississippi\u2019s Gestational Age Act provides that \u201c[e]xcept in a medical\nemergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall\nnot intentionally or knowingly perform . . . or induce an abortion of an\nunborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn hu-\nman being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks.\u201d\nMiss. Code Ann. \u00a741\u201341\u2013191. Respondents\u2014Jackson Women\u2019s Health\nOrganization, an abortion clinic, and one of its doctors\u2014challenged the\nAct in Federal District Court, alleging that it violated this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents establishing a constitutional right to abortion, in particular Roe\nv. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.\nv. Casey, 505 U. S. 833. The District Court granted summary judg-\nment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement\nof the Act, reasoning that Mississippi\u2019s 15-week restriction on abortion\nviolates this Court\u2019s cases forbidding States to ban abortion pre-viabil-\nity. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Before this Court, petitioners defend\nthe Act on the grounds that Roe and Casey were wrongly decided and\nthat the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review.\nHeld: The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey\nare overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the\npeople and their elected representatives. Pp. 8\u201379.\n(a) The critical question is whether the Constitution, properly un-\nderstood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. Casey\u2019s controlling\nopinion skipped over that question and reaffirmed Roe solely on the\nbasis of stare decisis. A proper application of stare decisis, however,\nrequires an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which Roe\n\n2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nSyllabus\nwas based. The Court therefore turns to the question that the Casey\nplurality did not consider. Pp. 8\u201332.\n(1) First, the Court reviews the standard that the Court\u2019s cases\nhave used to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s refer-\nence to \u201cliberty\u201d protects a particular right. The Constitution makes\nno express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, but several con-\nstitutional provisions have been offered as potential homes for an im-\nplicit constitutional right. Roe held that the abortion right is part of a\nright to privacy that springs from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and\nFourteenth Amendments. See 410 U. S., at 152\u2013153.",

Roe held that the abortion right is part of a\nright to privacy that springs from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and\nFourteenth Amendments. See 410 U. S., at 152\u2013153. The Casey Court\ngrounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an\nabortion is part of the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Others have suggested that support can\nbe found in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, but\nthat theory is squarely foreclosed by the Court\u2019s precedents, which es-\ntablish that a State\u2019s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classifi-\ncation and is thus not subject to the heightened scrutiny that applies\nto such classifications. See Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, 496,\nn. 20; Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273\u2013\n274. Rather, regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by\nthe same standard of review as other health and safety measures.\nPp. 9\u201311.\n(2) Next, the Court examines whether the right to obtain an abor-\ntion is rooted in the Nation\u2019s history and tradition and whether it is an\nessential component of \u201cordered liberty.\u201d The Court finds that the\nright to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation\u2019s history and tradi-\ntion. The underlying theory on which Casey rested\u2014that the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well\nas procedural, protection for \u201cliberty\u201d\u2014has long been controversial.\nThe Court\u2019s decisions have held that the Due Process Clause pro-\ntects two categories of substantive rights\u2014those rights guaranteed by\nthe first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights\ndeemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Consti-\ntution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories,\nthe question is whether the right is \u201cdeeply rooted in [our] history and\ntradition\u201d and whether it is essential to this Nation\u2019s \u201cscheme of or-\ndered liberty.\u201d Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The term \u201cliberty\u201d alone provides little guidance.\nThus, historical inquiries are essential whenever the Court is asked to\nrecognize a new component of the \u201cliberty\u201d interest protected by the\nDue Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by \u201cliberty,\u201d the\nCourt must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse\nwhat the Fourteenth Amendment protects with the Court\u2019s own ardent\nviews about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. For this reason,\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 3\nSyllabus\nthe Court has been \u201creluctant\u201d to recognize rights that are not men-\ntioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125.\nGuided by the history and tradition that map the essential compo-\nnents of the Nation\u2019s concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the\nFourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abor-\ntion. Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in\nAmerican law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state\nconstitutional provision had recognized such a right.",

Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in\nAmerican law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state\nconstitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years\nbefore Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor\nhad any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in\nevery single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least\nsome stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could\nhave very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed\nthe common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex-\npanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth\nAmendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abor-\ntion a crime at any stage of pregnancy. This consensus endured until\nthe day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or misstated this history,\nand Casey declined to reconsider Roe\u2019s faulty historical analysis.\nRespondents\u2019 argument that this history does not matter flies in the\nface of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an\nasserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is never-\ntheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Solicitor Gen-\neral repeats Roe\u2019s claim that it is \u201cdoubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly\nestablished as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruc-\ntion of a quick fetus,\u201d 410 U. S., at 136, but the great common-law au-\nthorities\u2014Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone\u2014all wrote that a post-\nquickening abortion was a crime. Moreover, many authorities as-\nserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was \u201cunlawful\u201d and that,\nas a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from\nthe attempt. The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an\nabortion right because of the common law\u2019s failure to criminalize abor-\ntion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not uni-\nversal, see Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633; State v. Slagle, 83\nN. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late\n18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abor-\ntions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the author-\nity to do so.\nInstead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right\nitself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the\nabortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe\ntermed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described\nit as the freedom to make \u201cintimate and personal choices\u201d that are\n\u201ccentral to personal dignity and autonomy,\u201d 505 U. S., at 851. Ordered\n\n4 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nSyllabus\nliberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing inter-\nests.

The Nation\u2019s historical understanding of ordered lib-\nerty does not prevent the people\u2019s elected representatives from decid-\ning how abortion should be regulated. Pp. 11\u201330.\n(3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abor-\ntion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other\nprecedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot\nbe justified as a component of such a right. Attempts to justify abor-\ntion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one\u2019s\n\u201cconcept of existence\u201d prove too much. Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Those\ncriteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights\nto illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. What sharply distin-\nguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on\nwhich Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions\nacknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what Roe\ntermed \u201cpotential life\u201d and what the law challenged in this case calls\nan \u201cunborn human being.\u201d None of the other decisions cited by Roe\nand Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. Ac-\ncordingly, those cases do not support the right to obtain an abortion,\nand the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such\na right does not undermine them in any way. Pp. 30\u201332.\n(b) The doctrine of stare decisis does not counsel continued ac-\nceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role and\nprotects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a\npast decision. It \u201creduces incentives for challenging settled prece-\ndents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation.\u201d\nKimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455. It \u201ccontrib-\nutes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d\nPayne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827. And it restrains judicial hubris\nby respecting the judgment of those who grappled with important\nquestions in the past. But stare decisis is not an inexorable command,\nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233, and \u201cis at its weakest when\n[the Court] interpret[s] the Constitution,\u201d Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S.\n203, 235. Some of the Court\u2019s most important constitutional decisions\nhave overruled prior precedents. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Educa-\ntion, 347 U.

Ferguson, Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision\ncourse with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey per-\npetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to\nresolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a win-\nning side. Those on the losing side\u2014those who sought to advance the\nState\u2019s interest in fetal life\u2014could no longer seek to persuade their\nelected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views.\nThe Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the\nlarge number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Pp. 43\u201345.\n(2) The quality of the reasoning. Without any grounding in the\nconstitutional text, history, or precedent, Roe imposed on the entire\ncountry a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters\nmuch like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation.\nSee 410 U. S., at 163\u2013164. Roe\u2019s failure even to note the overwhelming\nconsensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said\nabout the common law was simply wrong. Then, after surveying his-\ntory, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-\nfinding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did\nnot explain why the sources on which it relied shed light on the mean-\ning of the Constitution. As to precedent, citing a broad array of cases,\nthe Court found support for a constitutional \u201cright of personal privacy.\u201d\nId., at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from dis-\nclosure and the right to make and implement important personal de-\ncisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429\nU. S. 589, 599\u2013600. None of these decisions involved what is distinc-\ntive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed \u201cpotential life.\u201d\nWhen the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on\nthe country, it asserted that its rules were \u201cconsistent with,\u201d among\nother things, \u201cthe relative weights of the respective interests involved\u201d\nand \u201cthe demands of the profound problems of the present day.\u201d Roe,\n410 U. S., at 165. These are precisely the sort of considerations that\nlegislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that\naccommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked\nlike legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that\nmight be expected from a legislative body. An even more glaring defi-\nciency was Roe\u2019s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew be-\ntween pre- and post-viability abortions. See id., at 163.",

An even more glaring defi-\nciency was Roe\u2019s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew be-\ntween pre- and post-viability abortions. See id., at 163. The arbitrary\nviability line, which Casey termed Roe\u2019s central rule, has not found\nmuch support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted\nto justify a right to abortion. The most obvious problem with any such\n\n6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nSyllabus\nargument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily de-\npendent on factors\u2014such as medical advances and the availability of\nquality medical care\u2014that have nothing to do with the characteristics\nof a fetus.\nWhen Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roe\u2019s\ncentral holding, but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its rea-\nsoning. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and in-\nstead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The controlling opinion\ncriticized and rejected Roe\u2019s trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and\nsubstituted a new and obscure \u201cundue burden\u201d test. Casey, in short,\neither refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe\u2019s analy-\nsis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe\u2019s reasoning, endorsed\nwhat it termed Roe\u2019s central holding while suggesting that a majority\nmight not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the\nabortion right other than Roe\u2019s status as precedent, and imposed a new\ntest with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or prece-\ndent. Pp. 45\u201356.\n(3) Workability. Deciding whether a precedent should be over-\nruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workable\u2014that\nis, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and pre-\ndictable manner. Casey\u2019s \u201cundue burden\u201d test has scored poorly on the\nworkability scale. The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the\n\u201cundue burden\u201d test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these\nrules created their own problems. And the difficulty of applying Ca-\nsey\u2019s new rules surfaced in that very case. Compare 505 U. S., at 881\u2013\n887, with id., at 920\u2013922 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part). The experience of the Courts of Appeals provides further\nevidence that Casey\u2019s \u201cline between\u201d permissible and unconstitutional\nrestrictions \u201chas proved to be impossible to draw with precision.\u201d Ja-\nnus, 585 U. S., at ___. Casey has generated a long list of Circuit con-\nflicts. Continued adherence to Casey\u2019s unworkable \u201cundue burden\u201d\ntest would undermine, not advance, the \u201cevenhanded, predictable, and\nconsistent development of legal principles.\u201d Payne, 501 U. S., at 827.\nPp. 56\u201362.\n(4) Effect on other areas of law. Roe and Casey have led to the\ndistortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines, and that\neffect provides further support for overruling those decisions. See Ra-\nmos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in\npart). Pp. 62\u201363.\n(5) Reliance interests.",

Overruling Roe and Casey will not upend\nconcrete reliance interests like those that develop in \u201ccases involving\nproperty and contract rights.\u201d Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. In Casey, the\ncontrolling opinion conceded that traditional reliance interests were\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7\nSyllabus\nnot implicated because getting an abortion is generally \u201cunplanned ac-\ntivity,\u201d and \u201creproductive planning could take virtually immediate ac-\ncount of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.\u201d\n505 U. S., at 856. Instead, the opinion perceived a more intangible\nform of reliance, namely, that \u201cpeople [had] organized intimate rela-\ntionships and made choices that define their views of themselves and\ntheir places in society . . . in reliance on the availability of abortion in\nthe event that contraception should fail\u201d and that \u201c[t]he ability of\nwomen to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Na-\ntion has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive\nlives.\u201d Ibid. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and\nconflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the\nlives of women as well as the status of the fetus. The Casey plurality\u2019s\nspeculative attempt to weigh the relative importance of the interests\nof the fetus and the mother represent a departure from the \u201coriginal\nconstitutional proposition\u201d that \u201ccourts do not substitute their social\nand economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.\u201d Ferguson\nv. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729\u2013730.\nThe Solicitor General suggests that overruling Roe and Casey would\nthreaten the protection of other rights under the Due Process Clause.\nThe Court emphasizes that this decision concerns the constitutional\nright to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be\nunderstood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\nPp. 63\u201366.\n(c) Casey identified another concern, namely, the danger that the\npublic will perceive a decision overruling a controversial \u201cwatershed\u201d\ndecision, such as Roe, as influenced by political considerations or pub-\nlic opinion. 505 U. S., at 866\u2013867. But the Court cannot allow its de-\ncisions to be affected by such extraneous concerns. A precedent of this\nCourt is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which\nadherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If\nthe rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be\nthe law. The Court\u2019s job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding\nprinciples of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. Pp. 66\u201369.\n(d)Under the Court\u2019s precedents, rational-basis review is the appro-\npriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo con-\nstitutional challenge.",

Pp. 66\u201369.\n(d)Under the Court\u2019s precedents, rational-basis review is the appro-\npriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo con-\nstitutional challenge. Given that procuring an abortion is not a funda-\nmental constitutional right, it follows that the States may regulate\nabortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are chal-\nlenged under the Constitution, courts cannot \u201csubstitute their social\nand economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.\u201d Ferguson,\n372 U.

A law\nregulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a\n\n8 DOBBS v.

      "text": "LS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n[June 24, 2022]\nJUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\nAbortion presents a profound moral issue on which Amer-\nicans hold sharply conflicting views. Some believe fervently\nthat a human person comes into being at conception and\nthat abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel just as\nstrongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman\u2019s\nright to control her own body and prevents women from\nachieving full equality. Still others in a third group think\nthat abortion should be allowed under some but not all cir-\ncumstances, and those within this group hold a variety of\nviews about the particular restrictions that should be im-\nposed.\nFor the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitu-\ntion, each State was permitted to address this issue in ac-\ncordance with the views of its citizens. Then, in 1973, this\nCourt decided Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113. Even though the\nConstitution makes no mention of abortion, the Court held\nthat it confers a broad right to obtain one. It did not claim\nthat American law or the common law had ever recognized\n\n2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nOpinion of the Court\nsuch a right, and its survey of history ranged from the con-\nstitutionally irrelevant (e.g., its discussion of abortion in an-\ntiquity) to the plainly incorrect (e.g., its assertion that abor-\ntion was probably never a crime under the common law).\nAfter cataloging a wealth of other information having no\nbearing on the meaning of the Constitution, the opinion\nconcluded with a numbered set of rules much like those that\nmight be found in a statute enacted by a legislature.\nUnder this scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was reg-\nulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at\nroughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time,\ncorresponded to the point at which a fetus was thought to\nachieve \u201cviability,\u201d i.e., the ability to survive outside the\nwomb. Although the Court acknowledged that States had\na legitimate interest in protecting \u201cpotential life,\u201d1 it found\nthat this interest could not justify any restriction on pre-\nviability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for\nthis line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard\nto defend Roe\u2019s reasoning. One prominent constitutional\nscholar wrote that he \u201cwould vote for a statute very much\nlike the one the Court end[ed] up drafting\u201d if he were \u201ca\nlegislator,\u201d but his assessment of Roe was memorable and\nbrutal: Roe was \u201cnot constitutional law\u201d at all and gave \u201cal-\nmost no sense of an obligation to try to be.\u201d2\nAt the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at\nall stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third\nof the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly\nended that political process. It imposed the same highly\nrestrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively\nstruck down the abortion laws of every single State.3 As\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1 Roe v.

Two Justices ex-\npressed no desire to change Roe in any way.5 Four others\nwanted to overrule the decision in its entirety.6 And the\nthree remaining Justices, who jointly signed the controlling\nopinion, took a third position.7 Their opinion did not en-\ndorse Roe\u2019s reasoning, and it even hinted that one or more\nof its authors might have \u201creservations\u201d about whether the\nConstitution protects a right to abortion.8 But the opinion\nconcluded that stare decisis, which calls for prior decisions\nto be followed in most instances, required adherence to\nwhat it called Roe\u2019s \u201ccentral holding\u201d\u2014that a State may not\nconstitutionally protect fetal life before \u201cviability\u201d\u2014even if\nthat holding was wrong.9 Anything less, the opinion\nclaimed, would undermine respect for this Court and the\nrule of law.\nParadoxically, the judgment in Casey did a fair amount\nof overruling.

Some have\nrecently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few re-\nstrictions, at all stages of pregnancy. Others have tightly\nrestricted abortion beginning well before viability.

In defending\nthis law, the State\u2019s primary argument is that we should\nreconsider and overrule Roe and Casey and once again allow\neach State to regulate abortion as its citizens wish.

They tell us that \u201cno half-\nmeasures\u201d are available: We must either reaffirm or over-\nrule Roe and Casey. Brief for Respondents 50.\nII\nWe begin by considering the critical question whether the\nConstitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain\nan abortion. Skipping over that question, the controlling\nopinion in Casey reaffirmed Roe\u2019s \u201ccentral holding\u201d based\nsolely on the doctrine of stare decisis, but as we will explain,\nproper application of stare decisis required an assessment\nof the strength of the grounds on which Roe was based. See\ninfra, at 45\u201356.\nWe therefore turn to the question that the Casey plurality\ndid not consider, and we address that question in three\nsteps. First, we explain the standard that our cases have\nused in determining whether the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\nreference to \u201cliberty\u201d protects a particular right. Second,\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 9\nOpinion of the Court\nwe examine whether the right at issue in this case is rooted\nin our Nation\u2019s history and tradition and whether it is an\nessential component of what we have described as \u201cordered\nliberty.\u201d Finally, we consider whether a right to obtain an\nabortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is sup-\nported by other precedents.\nA\n1\nConstitutional analysis must begin with \u201cthe language of\nthe instrument,\u201d Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 186\u2013189\n(1824), which offers a \u201cfixed standard\u201d for ascertaining\nwhat our founding document means, 1 J. Story, Commen-\ntaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7399, p. 383\n(1833). The Constitution makes no express reference to a\nright to obtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim\nthat it protects such a right must show that the right is\nsomehow implicit in the constitutional text.\nRoe, however, was remarkably loose in its treatment of\nthe constitutional text. It held that the abortion right,\nwhich is not mentioned in the Constitution, is part of a right\nto privacy, which is also not mentioned. See 410 U. S., at\n152\u2013153. And that privacy right, Roe observed, had been\nfound to spring from no fewer than five different constitu-\ntional provisions\u2014the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and\nFourteenth Amendments. Id., at 152.\nThe Court\u2019s discussion left open at least three ways in\nwhich some combination of these provisions could protect\nthe abortion right.",

One possibility was that the right was\n\u201cfounded . . . in the Ninth Amendment\u2019s reservation of\nrights to the people.\u201d Id., at 153. Another was that the\nright was rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment,\nor in some combination of those provisions, and that this\nright had been \u201cincorporated\u201d into the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment just as many other Bill of\nRights provisions had by then been incorporated. Ibid; see\n\n10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nOpinion of the Court\nalso McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 763\u2013766 (2010)\n(majority opinion) (discussing incorporation). And a third\npath was that the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments\nplayed no role and that the right was simply a component\nof the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\nDue Process Clause. Roe, 410 U. S., at 153. Roe expressed\nthe \u201cfeel[ing]\u201d that the Fourteenth Amendment was the pro-\nvision that did the work, but its message seemed to be that\nthe abortion right could be found somewhere in the Consti-\ntution and that specifying its exact location was not of par-\namount importance.16 The Casey Court did not defend this\nunfocused analysis and instead grounded its decision solely\non the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of\nthe \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due\nProcess Clause.\nWe discuss this theory in depth below, but before doing\nso, we briefly address one additional constitutional provi-\nsion that some of respondents\u2019 amici have now offered as\nyet another potential home for the abortion right: the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 24 (Brief for United\nStates); see also Brief for Equal Protection Constitutional\nLaw Scholars as Amici Curiae. Neither Roe nor Casey saw\nfit to invoke this theory, and it is squarely foreclosed by our\nprecedents, which establish that a State\u2019s regulation of\nabortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not\nsubject to the \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d that applies to such\nclassifications.17 The regulation of a medical procedure that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n16The Court\u2019s words were as follows: \u201cThis right of privacy, whether it\nbe founded in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s concept of personal liberty\nand restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court\ndetermined, in the Ninth Amendment\u2019s reservation of rights to the peo-\nple, is broad enough to encompass a woman\u2019s decision whether or not to\nterminate her pregnancy.\u201d 410 U.

Com-\npare Brief for Scholars of Jurisprudence as Amici Curiae 12\u201314, and\nn. 32 (emphasis deleted) (\u201c \u2018a quick child\u2019 \u201d meant simply a \u201clive\u201d child,\nand under the era\u2019s outdated knowledge of embryology, a fetus was\nthought to become \u201cquick\u201d at around the sixth week of pregnancy), with\nBrief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 2\n(\u201cquick\u201d and \u201cquickening\u201d consistently meant \u201cthe woman\u2019s perception of\nfetal movement\u201d). We need not wade into this debate. First, it suffices\nfor present purposes to show that abortion was criminal by at least the\n16th or 18th week of pregnancy. Second, as we will show, during the\nrelevant period\u2014i.e., the period surrounding the enactment of the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2014the quickening distinction was abandoned as\nStates criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy.

See Leges Henrici Primi 222\u2013223 (L.

In 1732, for example,\nEleanor Beare was convicted of \u201cdestroying the Foetus in\nthe Womb\u201d of another woman and \u201cthereby causing her to\nmiscarry.\u201d26 For that crime and another \u201cmisdemeanor,\u201d\nBeare was sentenced to two days in the pillory and three\nyears\u2019 imprisonment.27\nAlthough a pre-quickening abortion was not itself consid-\nered homicide, it does not follow that abortion was permis-\nsible at common law\u2014much less that abortion was a legal\nright. Cf. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 713 (removal of \u201ccom-\nmon law\u2019s harsh sanctions did not represent an acceptance\nof suicide\u201d). Quite to the contrary, in the 1732 case men-\ntioned above, the judge said of the charge of abortion (with\nno mention of quickening) that he had \u201cnever met with a\ncase so barbarous and unnatural.\u201d28 Similarly, an indict-\nment from 1602, which did not distinguish between a pre-\nquickening and post-quickening abortion, described abor-\ntion as \u201cpernicious\u201d and \u201cagainst the peace of our Lady the\nQueen, her crown and dignity.\u201d Keown 7 (discussing R. v.\nWebb, Calendar of Assize Records, Surrey Indictments 512\n(1980)).\nThat the common law did not condone even pre-\nquickening abortions is confirmed by what one might call a\nproto-felony-murder rule. Hale and Blackstone explained a\nway in which a pre-quickening abortion could rise to the\nlevel of a homicide. Hale wrote that if a physician gave a\nwoman \u201cwith child\u201d a \u201cpotion\u201d to cause an abortion, and the\nwoman died, it was \u201cmurder\u201d because the potion was given\n\u201cunlawfully to destroy her child within her.\u201d 1 Hale 429\u2013\n430 (emphasis added).

In the case of an abortionist, Black-\nstone wrote, \u201cthe law will imply [malice]\u201d for the same rea-\nson that it would imply malice if a person who intended to\nkill one person accidentally killed a different person:\n\u201c[I]f one shoots at A and misses him, but kills B, this is\nmurder; because of the previous felonious intent, which\nthe law transfers from one to the other. The same is\nthe case, where one lays poison for A; and B, against\nwhom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it,\nand it kills him; this is likewise murder. So also, if one\ngives a woman with child a medicine to procure abor-\ntion, and it operates so violently as to kill the woman,\nthis is murder in the person who gave it.\u201d Id., at 200\u2013\n201 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).29\nNotably, Blackstone, like Hale, did not state that this\nproto-felony-murder rule required that the woman be \u201cwith\nquick child\u201d\u2014only that she be \u201cwith child.\u201d Id., at 201. And\nit is revealing that Hale and Blackstone treated abortion-\nists differently from other physicians or surgeons who\ncaused the death of a patient \u201cwithout any intent of doing\n[the patient] any bodily hurt.\u201d Hale 429; see 4 Blackstone\n197. These other physicians\u2014even if \u201cunlicensed\u201d\u2014would\nnot be \u201cguilty of murder or manslaughter.\u201d Hale 429. But\na physician performing an abortion would, precisely be-\ncause his aim was an \u201cunlawful\u201d one.\nIn sum, although common-law authorities differed on the\nseverity of punishment for abortions committed at different\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n29Other treatises restated the same rule. See 1 W. Russell & C.\nGreaves, Crimes and Misdemeanors 540 (5th ed. 1845) (\u201cSo where a per-\nson gave medicine to a woman to procure an abortion, and where a per-\nson put skewers into the woman for the same purpose, by which in both\ncases the women were killed, these acts were clearly held to be murder\u201d\n(footnotes omitted)); 1 E. East, Pleas of the Crown 230 (1803) (similar).\n\n20 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nOpinion of the Court\npoints in pregnancy, none endorsed the practice. Moreover,\nwe are aware of no common-law case or authority, and the\nparties have not pointed to any, that remotely suggests a\npositive right to procure an abortion at any stage of preg-\nnancy.\nb\nIn this country, the historical record is similar.

In Maryland in 1652,\nfor example, an indictment charged that a man \u201cMur-\ntherously endeavoured to destroy or Murther the Child by\nhim begotten in the Womb.\u201d Proprietary v. Mitchell, 10 Md.\nArchives 80, 183 (1652) (W. Browne ed. 1891). And by the\n19th century, courts frequently explained that the common\nlaw made abortion of a quick child a crime. See, e.g., Smith\nv. Gaffard, 31 Ala. 45, 51 (1857); Smith v. State, 33 Me. 48,\n55 (1851); State v. Cooper, 22 N. J. L. 52, 52\u201355 (1849); Com-\nmonwealth v.

At that time, there\nwere no scientific methods for detecting pregnancy in its\nearly stages,31 and thus, as one court put it in 1872: \u201c[U]ntil\nthe period of quickening there is no evidence of life; and\nwhatever may be said of the feotus, the law has fixed upon\nthis period of gestation as the time when the child is en-\ndowed with life\u201d because \u201cfoetal movements are the first\nclearly marked and well defined evidences of life.\u201d Evans v.\nPeople, 49 N.

JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nOpinion of the Court\nThe Solicitor General offers a different explanation of the\nbasis for the quickening rule, namely, that before quicken-\ning the common law did not regard a fetus \u201cas having a \u2018sep-\narate and independent existence.\u2019\u201d Brief for United States\n26 (quoting Parker, 50 Mass., at 266). But the case on\nwhich the Solicitor General relies for this proposition also\nsuggested that the criminal law\u2019s quickening rule was out\nof step with the treatment of prenatal life in other areas of\nlaw, noting that \u201cto many purposes, in reference to civil\nrights, an infant in ventre sa mere is regarded as a person\nin being.\u201d Ibid.

JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nOpinion of the Court\ncriminalized abortion at all stages, all but one did so by\n1910. See ibid.\nThe trend in the Territories that would become the last\n13 States was similar: All of them criminalized abortion at\nall stages of pregnancy between 1850 (the Kingdom of Ha-\nwaii) and 1919 (New Mexico). See Appendix B, infra; see\nalso Casey, 505 U. S., at 952 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring\nin judgment in part and dissenting in part); Dellapenna\n317\u2013319. By the end of the 1950s, according to the Roe\nCourt\u2019s own count, statutes in all but four States and the\nDistrict of Columbia prohibited abortion \u201chowever and\nwhenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the\nlife of the mother.\u201d 410 U. S., at 139.35\nThis overwhelming consensus endured until the day Roe\nwas decided. At that time, also by the Roe Court\u2019s own\ncount, a substantial majority\u201430 States\u2014still prohibited\nabortion at all stages except to save the life of the mother.\nSee id., at 118, and n. 2 (listing States). And though Roe\ndiscerned a \u201ctrend toward liberalization\u201d in about \u201cone-\nthird of the States,\u201d those States still criminalized some\nabortions and regulated them more stringently than Roe\nwould allow.

S., at 139 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn Massachusetts, case law held that abortion was allowed when, accord-\ning to the judgment of physicians in the relevant community, the proce-\ndure was necessary to preserve the woman\u2019s life or her physical or emo-\ntional health. Commonwealth v. Wheeler, 315 Mass. 394, 395, 53 N. E.\n2d 4, 5 (1944). In the other two States, however, there is no clear support\nin case law for the proposition that abortion was lawful where the\nmother\u2019s life was not at risk. See State v. Brandenberg, 137 N. J. L. 124,\n58 A. 2d 709 (1948); Commonwealth v. Trombetta, 131 Pa.

JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nOpinion of the Court\nlate 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-\nquickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought\nthe States lacked the authority to do so. When legislatures\nbegan to exercise that authority as the century wore on, no\none, as far as we are aware, argued that the laws they en-\nacted violated a fundamental right. That is not surprising\nsince common-law authorities had repeatedly condemned\nabortion and described it as an \u201cunlawful\u201d act without re-\ngard to whether it occurred before or after quickening. See\nsupra, at 16\u201321.\nAnother amicus brief relied upon by respondents (see\nBrief for Respondents 21) tries to dismiss the significance\nof the state criminal statutes that were in effect when the\nFourteenth Amendment was adopted by suggesting that\nthey were enacted for illegitimate reasons. According to\nthis account, which is based almost entirely on statements\nmade by one prominent proponent of the statutes, im-\nportant motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic im-\nmigrants were having more babies than Protestants and\nthat the availability of abortion was leading White\nProtestant women to \u201cshir[k their] maternal duties.\u201d Brief\nfor American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae\n20.\nResort to this argument is a testament to the lack of any\nreal historical support for the right that Roe and Casey rec-\nognized. This Court has long disfavored arguments based\non alleged legislative motives. See, e.g., Erie v. Pap\u2019s A. M.,\n529 U.

Recall that at the time of the adoption of the\nFourteenth Amendment, over three-quarters of the States\nhad adopted statutes criminalizing abortion (usually at all\nstages of pregnancy), and that from the early 20th century\nuntil the day Roe was handed down, every single State had\nsuch a law on its books. Are we to believe that the hundreds\nof lawmakers whose votes were needed to enact these laws\nwere motivated by hostility to Catholics and women?\nThere is ample evidence that the passage of these laws\nwas instead spurred by a sincere belief that abortion kills a\nhuman being. Many judicial decisions from the late 19th\nand early 20th centuries made that point. See, e.g., Nash\nv. Meyer, 54 Idaho 283, 301, 31 P. 2d 273, 280 (1934); State\nv.

We have held that the \u201cestab-\nlished method of substantive-due-process analysis\u201d re-\nquires that an unenumerated right be \u201c\u2018deeply rooted in\nthis Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u2019\u201d before it can be recog-\nnized as a component of the \u201cliberty\u201d protected in the Due\nProcess Clause. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; cf. Timbs,\n586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But despite the dissent\u2019s\nprofessed fidelity to stare decisis, it fails to seriously engage\nwith that important precedent\u2014which it cannot possibly\nsatisfy.\nThe dissent attempts to obscure this failure by misrepre-\nsenting our application of Glucksberg. The dissent suggests\nthat we have focused only on \u201cthe legal status of abortion in\nthe 19th century,\u201d post, at 26, but our review of this Na-\ntion\u2019s tradition extends well past that period. As explained,\nfor more than a century after 1868\u2014including \u201canother\nhalf-century\u201d after women gained the constitutional right\nto vote in 1920, see post, at 15; Amdt. 19\u2014it was firmly es-\ntablished that laws prohibiting abortion like the Texas law\nat issue in Roe were permissible exercises of state regula-\ntory authority. And today, another half century later, more\nthan half of the States have asked us to overrule Roe and\nCasey. The dissent cannot establish that a right to abortion\nhas ever been part of this Nation\u2019s tradition.\n2\nBecause the dissent cannot argue that the abortion right\nis rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition, it contends\nthat the \u201cconstitutional tradition\u201d is \u201cnot captured whole at\na single moment,\u201d and that its \u201cmeaning gains content from\nthe long sweep of our history and from successive judicial\nprecedents.\u201d Post, at 18 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted).",

This vague formulation imposes no clear restraints on\nwhat Justice White called the \u201cexercise of raw judicial\npower,\u201d Roe, 410 U.

First, if the \u201clong\nsweep of history\u201d imposes any restraint on the recognition\nof unenumerated rights, then Roe was surely wrong, since\nabortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the\nmother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before\nthat decision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to\ndefend Roe based on prior precedent because all of the prec-\nedents Roe cited, including Griswold and Eisenstadt, were\ncritically different for a reason that we have explained:\nNone of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe\ncalled \u201cpotential life.\u201d See supra, at 32.\nSo without support in history or relevant precedent, Roe\u2019s\nreasoning cannot be defended even under the dissent\u2019s pro-\nposed test, and the dissent is forced to rely solely on the fact\nthat a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe\nand later decisions that accepted Roe\u2019s interpretation. Un-\nder the doctrine of stare decisis, those precedents are enti-\ntled to careful and respectful consideration, and we engage\nin that analysis below. But as the Court has reiterated time\nand time again, adherence to precedent is not \u201c\u2018an inexora-\nble command.\u2019\u201d Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576\nU. S. 446, 455 (2015). There are occasions when past deci-\nsions should be overruled, and as we will explain, this is one\nof them.\n3\nThe most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of\nany serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States\u2019 inter-\nest in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogy\nthat the dissent draws between the abortion right and the\nrights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt\n(same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same\nsex), and Obergefell (same-sex marriage). Perhaps this is\n\n38 DOBBS v.

So if the rights\nat issue in those cases are fundamentally the same as the\nright recognized in Roe and Casey, the implication is clear:\nThe Constitution does not permit the States to regard the\ndestruction of a \u201cpotential life\u201d as a matter of any signifi-\ncance.\nThat view is evident throughout the dissent. The dissent\nhas much to say about the effects of pregnancy on women,\nthe burdens of motherhood, and the difficulties faced by\npoor women. These are important concerns. However, the\ndissent evinces no similar regard for a State\u2019s interest in\nprotecting prenatal life. The dissent repeatedly praises the\n\u201cbalance,\u201d post, at 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, that the viability line\nstrikes between a woman\u2019s liberty interest and the State\u2019s\ninterest in prenatal life. But for reasons we discuss later,\nsee infra, at 50\u201354, 55\u201356, and given in the opinion of THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE, post, at 2\u20135 (opinion concurring in judg-\nment), the viability line makes no sense. It was not ade-\nquately justified in Roe, and the dissent does not even try\nto defend it today. Nor does it identify any other point in a\npregnancy after which a State is permitted to prohibit the\ndestruction of a fetus.\nOur opinion is not based on any view about if and when\nprenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after\nbirth. The dissent, by contrast, would impose on the people\na particular theory about when the rights of personhood\nbegin. According to the dissent, the Constitution requires\nthe States to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basic\nhuman right\u2014to live\u2014at least until an arbitrary point in a\npregnancy has passed.

Stare de-\ncisis plays an important role in our case law, and we have\nexplained that it serves many valuable ends.

Those on the losing\nside\u2014those who sought to advance the State\u2019s interest in\nfetal life\u2014could no longer seek to persuade their elected\nrepresentatives to adopt policies consistent with their\nviews.

It stood on excep-\ntionally weak grounds.\nRoe found that the Constitution implicitly conferred a\nright to obtain an abortion, but it failed to ground its deci-\nsion in text, history, or precedent. It relied on an erroneous\nhistorical narrative; it devoted great attention to and pre-\nsumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the\nmeaning of the Constitution; it disregarded the fundamen-\ntal difference between the precedents on which it relied and\nthe question before the Court; it concocted an elaborate set\nof rules, with different restrictions for each trimester of\npregnancy, but it did not explain how this veritable code\ncould be teased out of anything in the Constitution, the his-\ntory of abortion laws, prior precedent, or any other cited\nsource; and its most important rule (that States cannot pro-\ntect fetal life prior to \u201cviability\u201d) was never raised by any\n\n46 DOBBS v.

Roe\u2019s rea-\nsoning quickly drew scathing scholarly criticism, even from\nsupporters of broad access to abortion.\nThe Casey plurality, while reaffirming Roe\u2019s central hold-\ning, pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reason-\ning. It revised the textual basis for the abortion right, si-\nlently abandoned Roe\u2019s erroneous historical narrative, and\njettisoned the trimester framework. But it replaced that\nscheme with an arbitrary \u201cundue burden\u201d test and relied on\nan exceptional version of stare decisis that, as explained be-\nlow, this Court had never before applied and has never in-\nvoked since.\n1\na\nThe weaknesses in Roe\u2019s reasoning are well-known.\nWithout any grounding in the constitutional text, history,\nor precedent, it imposed on the entire country a detailed set\nof rules much like those that one might expect to find in a\nstatute or regulation. See 410 U. S., at 163\u2013164. Dividing\npregnancy into three trimesters, the Court imposed special\nrules for each. During the first trimester, the Court an-\nnounced, \u201cthe abortion decision and its effectuation must be\nleft to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman\u2019s at-\ntending physician.\u201d Id., at 164.

Relying on two\ndiscredited articles by an abortion advocate, the Court er-\nroneously suggested\u2014contrary to Bracton, Coke, Hale,\nBlackstone, and a wealth of other authority\u2014that the com-\nmon law had probably never really treated post-quickening\nabortion as a crime. See id., at 136 (\u201c[I]t now appear[s]\ndoubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a com-\nmon-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a\nquick fetus\u201d). This erroneous understanding appears to\nhave played an important part in the Court\u2019s thinking be-\ncause the opinion cited \u201cthe lenity of the common law\u201d as\none of the four factors that informed its decision. Id., at\n165.\nAfter surveying history, the opinion spent many para-\ngraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be un-\ndertaken by a legislative committee. This included a\nlengthy account of the \u201cposition of the American Medical\nAssociation\u201d and \u201c[t]he position of the American Public\nHealth Association,\u201d as well as the vote by the American\nBar Association\u2019s House of Delegates in February 1972 on\nproposed abortion legislation. Id., at 141, 144, 146 (empha-\nsis deleted). Also noted were a British judicial decision\nhanded down in 1939 and a new British abortion law en-\nacted in 1967. Id., at 137\u2013138. The Court did not explain\nwhy these sources shed light on the meaning of the Consti-\ntution, and not one of them adopted or advocated anything\nlike the scheme that Roe imposed on the country.\nFinally, after all this, the Court turned to precedent. Cit-\ning a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a\nconstitutional \u201cright of personal privacy,\u201d id., at 152, but it\nconflated two very different meanings of the term: the right\n\nCite as: 597 U.

Only the cases involving this second sense\nof the term could have any possible relevance to the abor-\ntion issue, and some of the cases in that category involved\npersonal decisions that were obviously very, very far afield.\nSee Pierce, 268 U.

The definition of a \u201cviable\u201d fetus is one that is capable\nof surviving outside the womb, but why is this the point at\nwhich the State\u2019s interest becomes compelling? If, as Roe\nheld, a State\u2019s interest in protecting prenatal life is compel-\nling \u201cafter viability,\u201d 410 U.

JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nOpinion of the Court\nstate of neonatal care at a particular point in time. Due to\nthe development of new equipment and improved practices,\nthe viability line has changed over the years. In the 19th\ncentury, a fetus may not have been viable until the 32d or\n33d week of pregnancy or even later.51 When Roe was de-\ncided, viability was gauged at roughly 28 weeks. See 410\nU. S., at 160. Today, respondents draw the line at 23 or 24\nweeks. Brief for Respondents 8. So, according to Roe\u2019s logic,\nStates now have a compelling interest in protecting a fetus\nwith a gestational age of, say, 26 weeks, but in 1973 States\ndid not have an interest in protecting an identical fetus.\nHow can that be?\nViability also depends on the \u201cquality of the available\nmedical facilities.\u201d Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 396\n(1979). Thus, a 24-week-old fetus may be viable if a woman\ngives birth in a city with hospitals that provide advanced\ncare for very premature babies, but if the woman travels to\na remote area far from any such hospital, the fetus may no\nlonger be viable. On what ground could the constitutional\nstatus of a fetus depend on the pregnant woman\u2019s location?\nAnd if viability is meant to mark a line having universal\nmoral significance, can it be that a fetus that is viable in a\nbig city in the United States has a privileged moral status\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n51See W. Lusk, Science and the Art of Midwifery 74\u201375 (1882) (explain-\ning that \u201c[w]ith care, the life of a child born within [the eighth month of\npregnancy] may be preserved\u201d); id., at 326 (\u201cWhere the choice lies with\nthe physician, the provocation of labor is usually deferred until the\nthirty-third or thirty-fourth week\u201d); J. Beck, Researches in Medicine and\nMedical Jurisprudence 68 (2d ed. 1835) (\u201cAlthough children born before\nthe completion of the seventh month have occasionally survived, and\nbeen reared, yet in a medico-legal point of view, no child ought to be con-\nsidered as capable of sustaining an independent existence until the sev-\nenth month has been fully completed\u201d); see also J. Baker, The Incubator\nand the Medical Discovery of the Premature Infant, J.

In the sense relevant here, \u201csubstan-\ntial\u201d means \u201cof ample or considerable amount, quantity, or\nsize.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary\n1897 (2d ed. 2001). Huge burdens are plainly \u201csubstantial,\u201d\nand trivial ones are not, but in between these extremes,\nthere is a wide gray area.\nThis ambiguity is a problem, and the second rule, which\napplies at all stages of a pregnancy, muddies things further.\nIt states that measures designed \u201cto ensure that the\nwoman\u2019s choice is informed\u201d are constitutional so long as\nthey do not impose \u201can undue burden on the right.\u201d Casey,\n505 U.

Consider a law that\nimposes an insubstantial obstacle but serves little purpose.\nAs applied to a pre-viability abortion, would such a regula-\ntion be constitutional on the ground that it does not impose\na \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d?

Under\nthat rule, \u201c[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the\npurpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a\nwoman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the\nright.\u201d Casey, 505 U.

It includes the\ntwo already discussed\u2014\u201cundue burden\u201d and \u201csubstantial\nobstacle\u201d\u2014even though they are inconsistent. And it adds\na third ambiguous term when it refers to \u201cunnecessary\nhealth regulations.\u201d The term \u201cnecessary\u201d has a range of\nmeanings\u2014from \u201cessential\u201d to merely \u201cuseful.\u201d See Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979); American Heritage Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 877 (1971). Casey did not\nexplain the sense in which the term is used in this rule.\nIn addition to these problems, one more applies to all\nthree rules. They all call on courts to examine a law\u2019s effect\non women, but a regulation may have a very different im-\npact on different women for a variety of reasons, including\ntheir places of residence, financial resources, family situa-\ntions, work and personal obligations, knowledge about fetal\ndevelopment and abortion, psychological and emotional dis-\nposition and condition, and the firmness of their desire to\nobtain abortions.",

In order to determine whether a regula-\ntion presents a substantial obstacle to women, a court needs\nto know which set of women it should have in mind and how\nmany of the women in this set must find that an obstacle is\n\u201csubstantial.\u201d\nCasey provided no clear answer to these questions. It\nsaid that a regulation is unconstitutional if it imposes a\n\nCite as: 597 U.

Nor is it clear what the Court meant by \u201ccases in\nwhich\u201d a regulation is \u201crelevant.\u201d These ambiguities have\ncaused confusion and disagreement.

In Whole Woman\u2019s Health, the\nCourt adopted the cost-benefit interpretation of the test,\nstating that \u201c[t]he rule announced in Casey . . . requires\nthat courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion\naccess together with the benefits those laws confer.\u201d 579\nU.

S., at 856 (joint opinion); see also Payne, 501\nU. S., at 828. In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded\nthat those traditional reliance interests were not implicated\nbecause getting an abortion is generally \u201cunplanned activ-\nity,\u201d and \u201creproductive planning could take virtually imme-\ndiate account of any sudden restoration of state authority\nto ban abortions.\u201d 505 U. S., at 856. For these reasons, we\nagree with the Casey plurality that conventional, concrete\nreliance interests are not present here.\n2\nUnable to find reliance in the conventional sense, the con-\ntrolling opinion in Casey perceived a more intangible form\nof reliance. It wrote that \u201cpeople [had] organized intimate\nrelationships and made choices that define their views of\nthemselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the\navailability of abortion in the event that contraception\nshould fail\u201d and that \u201c[t]he ability of women to participate\nequally in the economic and social life of the Nation has\nbeen facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive\nlives.\u201d Ibid. But this Court is ill-equipped to assess \u201cgen-\neralized assertions about the national psyche.\u201d Id., at 957\n(opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.). Casey\u2019s notion of reliance thus\nfinds little support in our cases, which instead emphasize\nvery concrete reliance interests, like those that develop in\n\u201ccases involving property and contract rights.\u201d Payne, 501\nU. S., at 828.\nWhen a concrete reliance interest is asserted, courts are\nequipped to evaluate the claim, but assessing the novel and\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 65\nOpinion of the Court\nintangible form of reliance endorsed by the Casey plurality\nis another matter. That form of reliance depends on an em-\npirical question that is hard for anyone\u2014and in particular,\nfor a court\u2014to assess, namely, the effect of the abortion\nright on society and in particular on the lives of women.\nThe contending sides in this case make impassioned and\nconflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right\non the lives of women.

JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nOpinion of the Court\nthat the matter was closed. Id., at 867. That unprece-\ndented claim exceeded the power vested in us by the Con-\nstitution. As Alexander Hamilton famously put it, the Con-\nstitution gives the judiciary \u201cneither Force nor Will.\u201d The\nFederalist No. 78, p. 523 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Our sole au-\nthority is to exercise \u201cjudgment\u201d\u2014which is to say, the au-\nthority to judge what the law means and how it should ap-\nply to the case at hand. Ibid. The Court has no authority\nto decree that an erroneous precedent is permanently ex-\nempt from evaluation under traditional stare decisis princi-\nples. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual prin-\nciples of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent\nis the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule\nwere otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy and Loch-\nner would still be the law. That is not how stare decisis op-\nerates.\nThe Casey plurality also misjudged the practical limits of\nthis Court\u2019s influence. Roe certainly did not succeed in end-\ning division on the issue of abortion. On the contrary, Roe\n\u201cinflamed\u201d a national issue that has remained bitterly divi-\nsive for the past half century. Casey, 505 U. S., at 995 (opin-\nion of Scalia, J.); see also R. Ginsburg, Speaking in a Judi-\ncial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1185, 1208 (1992) (Roe may\nhave \u201chalted a political process,\u201d \u201cprolonged divisiveness,\u201d\nand \u201cdeferred stable settlement of the issue\u201d). And for the\npast 30 years, Casey has done the same.\nNeither decision has ended debate over the issue of a\nconstitutional right to obtain an abortion. Indeed, in this\ncase, 26 States expressly ask us to overrule Roe and Casey\nand to return the issue of abortion to the people and their\nelected representatives. This Court\u2019s inability to end de-\nbate on the issue should not have been surprising. This\nCourt cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a\nrancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settle-\nment and telling the people to move on. Whatever influence\nthe Court may have on public attitudes must stem from the\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 69\nOpinion of the Court\nstrength of our opinions, not an attempt to exercise \u201craw\njudicial power.\u201d Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (White, J., dissent-\ning).\nWe do not pretend to know how our political system or\nsociety will respond to today\u2019s decision overruling Roe and\nCasey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we\nwould have no authority to let that knowledge influence our\ndecision. We can only do our job, which is to interpret the\nlaw, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and de-\ncide this case accordingly.\nWe therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a\nright to abortion.

Recognition\nthat the cases they overruled were egregiously wrong on the\nday they were handed down was not enough.\nThe Court has never adopted this strange new version of\n\n70 DOBBS v.

Does the dissent really\nmaintain that overruling Plessy was not justified until the\ncountry had experienced more than a half-century of state-\nsanctioned segregation and generations of Black school\nchildren had suffered all its effects? Post, at 44\u201345.\nHere is another example. On the dissent\u2019s view, it must\nhave been wrong for West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette,\n319 U. S. 624, to overrule Minersville School Dist. v. Gobi-\ntis, 310 U. S. 586, a bare three years after it was handed\ndown. In both cases, children who were Jehovah\u2019s Wit-\nnesses refused on religious grounds to salute the flag or re-\ncite the pledge of allegiance. The Barnette Court did not\nclaim that its reexamination of the issue was prompted by\nany intervening legal or factual developments, so if the\nCourt had followed the dissent\u2019s new version of stare deci-\nsis, it would have been compelled to adhere to Gobitis and\ncountenance continued First Amendment violations for\nsome unspecified period.\nPrecedents should be respected, but sometimes the Court\nerrs, and occasionally the Court issues an important deci-\nsion that is egregiously wrong. When that happens, stare\ndecisis is not a straitjacket. And indeed, the dissent even-\ntually admits that a decision could \u201cbe overruled just be-\ncause it is terribly wrong,\u201d though the dissent does not ex-\nplain when that would be so.

We have also explained why that is so: rights regard-\ning contraception and same-sex relationships are inher-\nently different from the right to abortion because the latter\n(as we have stressed) uniquely involves what Roe and Casey\ntermed \u201cpotential life.\u201d Roe, 410 U. S., at 150 (emphasis de-\nleted); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. Therefore, a right to abor-\ntion cannot be justified by a purported analogy to the rights\nrecognized in those other cases or by \u201cappeals to a broader\nright to autonomy.\u201d Supra, at 32. It is hard to see how we\ncould be clearer. Moreover, even putting aside that these\ncases are distinguishable, there is a further point that the\ndissent ignores: Each precedent is subject to its own stare\n\n72 DOBBS v.

S., at 388\u2013389.\nIt then struck down Pennsylvania\u2019s definition of viability,\nid., at 389\u2013394, and it is hard to see how the Court could\nhave done that if Roe\u2019s discussion of viability was not part\nof its holding.\nWhen the Court reconsidered Roe in Casey, it left no\ndoubt about the importance of the viability rule. It de-\nscribed the rule as Roe\u2019s \u201ccentral holding,\u201d 505 U. S., at 860,\nand repeatedly stated that the right it reaffirmed was \u201cthe\nright of the woman to choose to have an abortion before vi-\nability.\u201d Id., at 846 (emphasis added). See id., at 871 (\u201cThe\nwoman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy before viability\nis the most central principle of Roe v. Wade. It is a rule of\nlaw and a component of liberty we cannot renounce\u201d (em-\nphasis added)); id., at 872 (A \u201cwoman has a right to choose\nto terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability\u201d\n(emphasis added)); id., at 879 (\u201c[A] State may not prohibit\nany woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate\nher pregnancy before viability\u201d (emphasis added)).\nOur subsequent cases have continued to recognize the\ncentrality of the viability rule. See Whole Women\u2019s Health,\n579 U.

See 505 U. S., at 887\u2013\n898. The same is true of Whole Women\u2019s Health, which held\nthat certain rules that required physicians performing\nabortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital\nwere facially unconstitutional because they placed \u201ca sub-\nstantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previabil-\nity abortion.\u201d 579 U.

If that rule is to become the law of the land, it must\nstand on its own, but the concurrence makes no attempt to\nshow that this rule represents a correct interpretation of\nthe Constitution. The concurrence does not claim that the\nright to a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion is\n\u201c\u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u2019\u201d and\n\u201c\u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019\u201d Glucksberg,\n521 U.

And if the Constitution protects a woman\u2019s right to\nobtain an abortion, the opinion does not explain why that\nright should end after the point at which all \u201creasonable\u201d\nwomen will have decided whether to seek an abortion.\nWhile the concurrence is moved by a desire for judicial min-\nimalism, \u201cwe cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision\nsimply because it is narrow; it must also be right.\u201d Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.

For example,\nif the period required to give women a \u201creasonable\u201d oppor-\ntunity to obtain an abortion were pegged, as the concur-\nrence seems to suggest, at the point when a certain percent-\nage of women make that choice, see post, at 1\u20132, 9\u201310, we\nwould have to identify the relevant percentage.

As we have explained,\nprocuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional\nright because such a right has no basis in the Constitution\u2019s\ntext or in our Nation\u2019s history. See supra, at 8\u201339.\nIt follows that the States may regulate abortion for legit-\nimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged\nunder the Constitution, courts cannot \u201csubstitute their so-\ncial and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bod-\nies.\u201d Ferguson, 372 U.

The resolution of this case is thus\nstraightforward. Because the Due Process Clause does not\nsecure any substantive rights, it does not secure a right to\nabortion.\nThe Court today declines to disturb substantive due pro-\ncess jurisprudence generally or the doctrine\u2019s application in\nother, specific contexts. Cases like Griswold v. Connecticut,\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 3\nTHOMAS, J., concurring\n381 U. S. 479 (1965) (right of married persons to obtain con-\ntraceptives)*; Lawrence v.

The Court\u2019s abortion cases are\nunique, see ante, at 31\u201332, 66, 71\u201372, and no party has\nasked us to decide \u201cwhether our entire Fourteenth Amend-\nment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised,\u201d McDon-\nald, 561 U.

After overruling these demonstra-\nbly erroneous decisions, the question would remain\nwhether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myr-\niad rights that our substantive due process cases have gen-\nerated. For example, we could consider whether any of the\nrights announced in this Court\u2019s substantive due process\ncases are \u201cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United\nStates\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

To answer that question, we would need to decide im-\nportant antecedent questions, including whether the Privi-\nleges or Immunities Clause protects any rights that are not\nenumerated in the Constitution and, if so, how to identify\nthose rights. See id., at 854. That said, even if the Clause\ndoes protect unenumerated rights, the Court conclusively\ndemonstrates that abortion is not one of them under any\nplausible interpretive approach.

S. ____ (2022) 5\nTHOMAS, J., concurring\nabortion because it \u201cfe[lt]\u201d that \u201cthe Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s concept of personal liberty\u201d included a \u201cright of pri-\nvacy\u201d that \u201cis broad enough to encompass a woman\u2019s deci-\nsion whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\u201d Id., at\n153. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,\n505 U. S. 833 (1992), the Court likewise identified an abor-\ntion guarantee in \u201cthe liberty protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment,\u201d but, rather than a \u201cright of privacy,\u201d it in-\nvoked an ethereal \u201cright to define one\u2019s own concept of ex-\nistence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of\nhuman life.\u201d Id., at 851. As the Court\u2019s preferred manifes-\ntation of \u201cliberty\u201d changed, so, too, did the test used to pro-\ntect it, as Roe\u2019s author lamented. See Casey, 505 U. S., at\n930 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (\u201c[T]he Roe framework is far more administrable, and\nfar less manipulable, than the \u2018undue burden\u2019 standard\u201d).\nNow, in this case, the nature of the purported \u201cliberty\u201d\nsupporting the abortion right has shifted yet again. Re-\nspondents and the United States propose no fewer than\nthree different interests that supposedly spring from the\nDue Process Clause. They include \u201cbodily integrity,\u201d \u201cper-\nsonal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and\nfaith,\u201d Brief for Respondents 21, and \u201cwomen\u2019s equal citi-\nzenship,\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24. That\n50 years have passed since Roe and abortion advocates still\ncannot coherently articulate the right (or rights) at stake\nproves the obvious: The right to abortion is ultimately a pol-\nicy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification.\nSecond, substantive due process distorts other areas of\nconstitutional law. For example, once this Court identifies\na \u201cfundamental\u201d right for one class of individuals, it invokes\nthe Equal Protection Clause to demand exacting scrutiny of\nstatutes that deny the right to others.

They contend that the widespread availa-\nbility of abortion has been essential for women to advance\nin society and to achieve greater equality over the last 50\nyears. And they maintain that women must have the free-\ndom to choose for themselves whether to have an abortion.\nOn the other side, many pro-life advocates forcefully ar-\ngue that a fetus is a human life.

To be\nsure, this Court has held that the Constitution protects un-\nenumerated rights that are deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s\nhistory and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered\nliberty. But a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in Amer-\nican history and tradition, as the Court today thoroughly\nexplains.1\nOn the question of abortion, the Constitution is therefore\nneither pro-life nor pro-choice.

As I see it, the dispositive\npoint in analyzing American history and tradition for purposes of the\nFourteenth Amendment inquiry is that abortion was largely prohibited\nin most American States as of 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment\nwas ratified, and that abortion remained largely prohibited in most\nAmerican States until Roe was decided in 1973.\n\nCite as: 597 U.

Georgia,\n408 U. S. 238, 467 (1972) (dissenting opinion); see Washing-\nton v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720\u2013721 (1997); Cruzan v.\nDirector, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 292\u2013293 (1990)\n(Scalia, J., concurring).\nThis Court therefore does not possess the authority either\nto declare a constitutional right to abortion or to declare a\nconstitutional prohibition of abortion. See Casey, 505 U. S.,\nat 953 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part); id., at 980 (opinion of Scalia, J.); Roe v.\nWade, 410 U. S. 113, 177 (1973) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting);\nDoe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179, 222 (1973) (White, J., dissent-\ning).\nIn sum, the Constitution is neutral on the issue of abor-\ntion and allows the people and their elected representatives\nto address the issue through the democratic process. In my\nrespectful view, the Court in Roe therefore erred by taking\nsides on the issue of abortion.\nII\nThe more difficult question in this case is stare decisis\u2014\nthat is, whether to overrule the Roe decision.\nThe principle of stare decisis requires respect for the\n\n6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nCourt\u2019s precedents and for the accumulated wisdom of the\njudges who have previously addressed the same issue.\nStare decisis is rooted in Article III of the Constitution and\nis fundamental to the American judicial system and to the\nstability of American law.\nAdherence to precedent is the norm, and stare decisis im-\nposes a high bar before this Court may overrule a prece-\ndent. This Court\u2019s history shows, however, that stare deci-\nsis is not absolute, and indeed cannot be absolute.\nOtherwise, as the Court today explains, many long-since-\noverruled cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537\n(1896); Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905); Miners-\nville School Dist. v. Gobitis, 310 U. S. 586 (1940); and Bow-\ners v.",

Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393,\n406\u2212407 (1932) (dissenting opinion). That description of\nthe Court\u2019s practice remains accurate today. Every current\nMember of this Court has voted to overrule precedent. And\nover the last 100 years beginning with Chief Justice Taft\u2019s\nappointment in 1921, every one of the 48 Justices appointed\nto this Court has voted to overrule precedent. Many of\nthose Justices have voted to overrule a substantial number\nof very significant and longstanding precedents. See, e.g.,\nObergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (overruling Baker\nv. Nelson); Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483\n(1954) (overruling Plessy v. Ferguson); West Coast Hotel Co.\nv. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937) (overruling Adkins v. Chil-\ndren\u2019s Hospital of D. C. and in effect Lochner v. New York).\nBut that history alone does not answer the critical ques-\ntion: When precisely should the Court overrule an errone-\nous constitutional precedent? The history of stare decisis in\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nthis Court establishes that a constitutional precedent may\nbe overruled only when (i) the prior decision is not just\nwrong, but is egregiously wrong, (ii) the prior decision has\ncaused significant negative jurisprudential or real-world\nconsequences, and (iii) overruling the prior decision would\nnot unduly upset legitimate reliance interests. See Ramos\nv. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___\u2212___ (2020) (KAVANAUGH, J.,\nconcurring in part) (slip op., at 7\u22128).\nApplying those factors, I agree with the Court today that\nRoe should be overruled. The Court in Roe erroneously as-\nsigned itself the authority to decide a critically important\nmoral and policy issue that the Constitution does not grant\nthis Court the authority to decide. As Justice Byron White\nsuccinctly explained, Roe was \u201can improvident and extrav-\nagant exercise of the power of judicial review\u201d because\n\u201cnothing in the language or history of the Constitution\u201d sup-\nports a constitutional right to abortion. Bolton, 410 U. S.,\nat 221\u2212222 (dissenting opinion).\nOf course, the fact that a precedent is wrong, even egre-\ngiously wrong, does not alone mean that the precedent\nshould be overruled.

All of that explains why tens of millions of\nAmericans\u2014and the 26 States that explicitly ask the Court\nto overrule Roe\u2014do not accept Roe even 49 years later.\nUnder the Court\u2019s longstanding stare decisis principles, Roe\n\n8 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nshould be overruled.3\nBut the stare decisis analysis here is somewhat more\ncomplicated because of Casey. In 1992, 19 years after Roe,\nCasey acknowledged the continuing dispute over Roe. The\nCourt sought to find common ground that would resolve the\nabortion debate and end the national controversy. After\ncareful and thoughtful consideration, the Casey plurality\nreaffirmed a right to abortion through viability (about 24\nweeks), while also allowing somewhat more regulation of\nabortion than Roe had allowed.4\nI have deep and unyielding respect for the Justices who\nwrote the Casey plurality opinion. And I respect the Casey\nplurality\u2019s good-faith effort to locate some middle ground or\ncompromise that could resolve this controversy for America.\nBut as has become increasingly evident over time, Casey\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n3I also agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion today with respect to reliance.\nBroad notions of societal reliance have been invoked in support of Roe,\nbut the Court has not analyzed reliance in that way in the past. For\nexample, American businesses and workers relied on Lochner v. New\nYork, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), and Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hospital of D. C., 261\nU. S. 525 (1923), to construct a laissez-faire economy that was free of\nsubstantial regulation. In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379\n(1937), the Court nonetheless overruled Adkins and in effect Lochner.\nAn entire region of the country relied on Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S.\n537 (1896), to enforce a system of racial segregation. In Brown v. Board\nof Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court overruled Plessy. Much of\nAmerican society was built around the traditional view of marriage that\nwas upheld in Baker v. Nelson, 409 U. S. 810 (1972), and that was re-\nflected in laws ranging from tax laws to estate laws to family laws. In\nObergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015), the Court nonetheless over-\nruled Baker.\n4As the Court today notes, Casey\u2019s approach to stare decisis pointed in\ntwo directions.

S., at 870, 872\u2212873, 878\u2212879, 882. Casey itself thus directly con-\ntradicts any notion of absolute stare decisis in abortion cases.\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 9\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nwell-intentioned effort did not resolve the abortion debate.\nThe national division has not ended. In recent years, a sig-\nnificant number of States have enacted abortion re-\nstrictions that directly conflict with Roe. Those laws cannot\nbe dismissed as political stunts or as outlier laws. Those\nnumerous state laws collectively represent the sincere and\ndeeply held views of tens of millions of Americans who con-\ntinue to fervently believe that allowing abortions up to 24\nweeks is far too radical and far too extreme, and does not\nsufficiently account for what Roe itself recognized as the\nState\u2019s \u201cimportant and legitimate interest\u201d in protecting fe-\ntal life. 410 U. S., at 162. In this case, moreover, a majority\nof the States\u201426 in all\u2014ask the Court to overrule Roe and\nreturn the abortion issue to the States.\nIn short, Casey\u2019s stare decisis analysis rested in part on a\npredictive judgment about the future development of state\nlaws and of the people\u2019s views on the abortion issue. But\nthat predictive judgment has not borne out. As the Court\ntoday explains, the experience over the last 30 years con-\nflicts with Casey\u2019s predictive judgment and therefore under-\nmines Casey\u2019s precedential force.5\nIn any event, although Casey is relevant to the stare de-\ncisis analysis, the question of whether to overrule Roe can-\nnot be dictated by Casey alone. To illustrate that stare de-\ncisis point, consider an example. Suppose that in 1924 this\nCourt had expressly reaffirmed Plessy v. Ferguson and up-\nheld the States\u2019 authority to segregate people on the basis\nof race. Would the Court in Brown some 30 years later in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n5To be clear, public opposition to a prior decision is not a basis for over-\nruling (or reaffirming) that decision. Rather, the question of whether to\noverrule a precedent must be analyzed under this Court\u2019s traditional\nstare decisis factors. The only point here is that Casey adopted a special\nstare decisis principle with respect to Roe based on the idea of resolving\nthe national controversy and ending the national division over abortion.\nThe continued and significant opposition to Roe, as reflected in the laws\nand positions of numerous States, is relevant to assessing Casey on its\nown terms.",

That issue will be re-\nsolved by the people and their representatives in the demo-\ncratic process in the States or Congress. But the parties\u2019\narguments have raised other related questions, and I ad-\ndress some of them here.\nFirst is the question of how this decision will affect other\nprecedents involving issues such as contraception and mar-\nriage\u2014in particular, the decisions in Griswold v. Connecti-\ncut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438\n(1972); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Oberge-\nfell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015). I emphasize what the\nCourt today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the over-\nruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast\ndoubt on those precedents.\nSecond, as I see it, some of the other abortion-related le-\ngal questions raised by today\u2019s decision are not especially\ndifficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a\nState bar a resident of that State from traveling to another\nState to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no\nbased on the constitutional right to interstate travel. May\na State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an\nabortion that occurred before today\u2019s decision takes effect?\nIn my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process\nClause or the Ex Post Facto Clause. Cf. Bouie v. City of\nColumbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964).\nOther abortion-related legal questions may emerge in the\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 11\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nfuture. But this Court will no longer decide the fundamen-\ntal question of whether abortion must be allowed through-\nout the United States through 6 weeks, or 12 weeks, or 15\nweeks, or 24 weeks, or some other line. The Court will no\nlonger decide how to evaluate the interests of the pregnant\nwoman and the interests in protecting fetal life throughout\npregnancy. Instead, those difficult moral and policy ques-\ntions will be decided, as the Constitution dictates, by the\npeople and their elected representatives through the consti-\ntutional processes of democratic self-government.\n* * *\nThe Roe Court took sides on a consequential moral and\npolicy issue that this Court had no constitutional authority\nto decide.

I would take a more measured course. I agree\nwith the Court that the viability line established by Roe and\nCasey should be discarded under a straightforward stare de-\ncisis analysis. That line never made any sense. Our abor-\ntion precedents describe the right at issue as a woman\u2019s\nright to choose to terminate her pregnancy. That right\nshould therefore extend far enough to ensure a reasonable\nopportunity to choose, but need not extend any further\u2014\n\n2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\ncertainly not all the way to viability. Mississippi\u2019s law al-\nlows a woman three months to obtain an abortion, well be-\nyond the point at which it is considered \u201clate\u201d to discover a\npregnancy. See A. Ayoola, Late Recognition of Unintended\nPregnancies, 32 Pub. Health Nursing 462 (2015) (preg-\nnancy is discoverable and ordinarily discovered by six\nweeks of gestation). I see no sound basis for questioning\nthe adequacy of that opportunity.\nBut that is all I would say, out of adherence to a simple\nyet fundamental principle of judicial restraint: If it is not\nnecessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is nec-\nessary not to decide more. Perhaps we are not always per-\nfect in following that command, and certainly there are\ncases that warrant an exception. But this is not one of\nthem. Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judi-\ncial restraint here, where the broader path the Court\nchooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have\nnot only previously recognized, but also expressly reaf-\nfirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis. The Court\u2019s\nopinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues can-\nnot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and conse-\nquential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us.\nI\nLet me begin with my agreement with the Court, on the\nonly question we need decide here: whether to retain the\nrule from Roe and Casey that a woman\u2019s right to terminate\nher pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is re-\ngarded as \u201cviable\u201d outside the womb. I agree that this rule\nshould be discarded.\nFirst, this Court seriously erred in Roe in adopting via-\nbility as the earliest point at which a State may legislate to\nadvance its substantial interests in the area of abortion.\nSee ante, at 50\u201353. Roe set forth a rigid three-part frame-\nwork anchored to viability, which more closely resembled a\nregulatory code than a body of constitutional law. That",

Roe set forth a rigid three-part frame-\nwork anchored to viability, which more closely resembled a\nregulatory code than a body of constitutional law. That\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 3\nROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\nframework, moreover, came out of thin air. Neither the\nTexas statute challenged in Roe nor the Georgia statute at\nissue in its companion case, Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179\n(1973), included any gestational age limit. No party or ami-\ncus asked the Court to adopt a bright line viability rule.\nAnd as for Casey, arguments for or against the viability rule\nplayed only a de minimis role in the parties\u2019 briefing and in\nthe oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17\u201318, 51 (fleeting\ndiscussion of the viability rule).\nIt is thus hardly surprising that neither Roe nor Casey\nmade a persuasive or even colorable argument for why the\ntime for terminating a pregnancy must extend to viability.\nThe Court\u2019s jurisprudence on this issue is a textbook illus-\ntration of the perils of deciding a question neither presented\nnor briefed. As has been often noted, Roe\u2019s defense of the\nline boiled down to the circular assertion that the State\u2019s\ninterest is compelling only when an unborn child can live\noutside the womb, because that is when the unborn child\ncan live outside the womb. See 410 U. S., at 163\u2013164; see\nalso J. Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe\nv. Wade, 82 Yale L. J. 920, 924 (1973) (Roe\u2019s reasoning \u201cmis-\ntake[s] a definition for a syllogism\u201d).\nTwenty years later, the best defense of the viability line\nthe Casey plurality could conjure up was workability. See\n505 U. S., at 870. But see ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court)\n(discussing the difficulties in applying the viability stand-\nard). Although the plurality attempted to add more content\nby opining that \u201cit might be said that a woman who fails to\nact before viability has consented to the State\u2019s intervention\non behalf of the developing child,\u201d Casey, 505 U. S., at 870,\nthat mere suggestion provides no basis for choosing viabil-\nity as the critical tipping point. A similar implied consent\nargument could be made with respect to a law banning\nabortions after fifteen weeks, well beyond the point at\nwhich nearly all women are aware that they are pregnant,\nA.

Id., at 157\u2013160. The viability line has\nnothing to do with advancing such permissible goals. Cf.\nid., at 171 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (Gonzales \u201cblur[red]\nthe line, firmly drawn in Casey, between previability and\npostviability abortions\u201d); see also R. Beck, Gonzales, Casey,\nand the Viability Rule, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 249, 276\u2013279\n(2009).\nConsider, for example, statutes passed in a number of ju-\nrisdictions that forbid abortions after twenty weeks of preg-\nnancy, premised on the theory that a fetus can feel pain at\nthat stage of development. See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a726\u201323B\u20132\n(2018). Assuming that prevention of fetal pain is a legiti-\nmate state interest after Gonzales, there seems to be no rea-\nson why viability would be relevant to the permissibility of\nsuch laws. The same is true of laws designed to \u201cprotect[]\nthe integrity and ethics of the medical profession\u201d and re-\nstrict procedures likely to \u201ccoarsen society\u201d to the \u201cdignity\nof human life.\u201d Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 157. Mississippi\u2019s\nlaw, for instance, was premised in part on the legislature\u2019s\nfinding that the \u201cdilation and evacuation\u201d procedure is a\n\u201cbarbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and\n\nCite as: 597 U.

That procedure accounts for most\nabortions performed after the first trimester\u2014two weeks\nbefore the period at issue in this case\u2014and \u201cinvolve[s] the\nuse of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn\nchild apart.\u201d Ibid.; see also Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 135.\nAgain, it would make little sense to focus on viability when\nevaluating a law based on these permissible goals.\nIn short, the viability rule was created outside the ordi-\nnary course of litigation, is and always has been completely\nunreasoned, and fails to take account of state interests\nsince recognized as legitimate. It is indeed \u201ctelling that\nother countries almost uniformly eschew\u201d a viability line.\nAnte, at 53 (opinion of the Court). Only a handful of coun-\ntries, among them China and North Korea, permit elective\nabortions after twenty weeks; the rest have coalesced\naround a 12\u2013week line. See The World\u2019s Abortion Laws,\nCenter for Reproductive Rights (Feb. 23, 2021) (online\nsource archived at www.supremecourt.gov) (Canada,\nChina, Iceland, Guinea-Bissau, the Netherlands, North Ko-\nrea, Singapore, and Vietnam permit elective abortions after\ntwenty weeks).

The State made a number of strong arguments\nthat the answer is no, id., at 15\u201326\u2014arguments that, as\ndiscussed, I find persuasive. And it went out of its way to\nmake clear that it was not asking the Court to repudiate\n\n6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nROBERTS, C.

But the State never argued that we should\ngrant review for that purpose.\nAfter we granted certiorari, however, Mississippi\nchanged course. In its principal brief, the State bluntly an-\nnounced that the Court should overrule Roe and Casey. The\nConstitution does not protect a right to an abortion, it ar-\ngued, and a State should be able to prohibit elective abor-\ntions if a rational basis supports doing so. See Brief for Pe-\ntitioners 12\u201313.\nThe Court now rewards that gambit, noting three times\nthat the parties presented \u201cno half-measures\u201d and argued\nthat \u201cwe must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey.\u201d\nAnte, at 5, 8, 72. Given those two options, the majority picks\nthe latter.\nThis framing is not accurate. In its brief on the merits,\nMississippi in fact argued at length that a decision simply\nrejecting the viability rule would result in a judgment in its\nfavor. See Brief for Petitioners 5, 38\u201348. But even if the\nState had not argued as much, it would not matter. There\nis no rule that parties can confine this Court to disposing of\ntheir case on a particular ground\u2014let alone when review\nwas sought and granted on a different one.

The question in Roe was\nwhether there was any right to abortion in the Constitu-\ntion. See Brief for Appellants and Brief for Appellees, in\nRoe v. Wade, O. T. 1971, No. 70\u201318. How far the right ex-\ntended was a concern that was separate and subsidiary,\nand\u2014not surprisingly\u2014entirely unbriefed.\nThe Court in Roe just chose to address both issues in one\nopinion: It first recognized a right to \u201cchoose to terminate\n[a] pregnancy\u201d under the Constitution, see 410 U. S., at\n129\u2013159, and then, having done so, explained that a line\nshould be drawn at viability such that a State could not pro-\nscribe abortion before that period, see id., at 163. The via-\nbility line is a separate rule fleshing out the metes and\nbounds of Roe\u2019s core holding.

J., concurring in judgment\nrule\u2014from our jurisprudence.\nThe majority lists a number of cases that have stressed\nthe importance of the viability rule to our abortion prece-\ndents. See ante, at 73\u201374. I agree that\u2014whether it was\noriginally holding or dictum\u2014the viability line is clearly\npart of our \u201cpast precedent,\u201d and the Court has applied it as\nsuch in several cases since Roe. Ante, at 73. My point is\nthat Roe adopted two distinct rules of constitutional law:\none, that a woman has the right to choose to terminate a\npregnancy; two, that such right may be overridden by the\nState\u2019s legitimate interests when the fetus is viable outside\nthe womb. The latter is obviously distinct from the former.\nI would abandon that timing rule, but see no need in this\ncase to consider the basic right.\nThe Court contends that it is impossible to address Roe\u2019s\nconclusion that the Constitution protects the woman\u2019s right\nto abortion, without also addressing Roe\u2019s rule that the\nState\u2019s interests are not constitutionally adequate to justify\na ban on abortion until viability. See ibid. But we have\npartially overruled precedents before, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Miller, 471 U. S. 130, 142\u2013144 (1985); Daniels v.\nWilliams, 474 U.

The law at issue allows abor-\ntions up through fifteen weeks, providing an adequate op-\nportunity to exercise the right Roe protects. By the time a\npregnant woman has reached that point, her pregnancy is\nwell into the second trimester. Pregnancy tests are now in-\nexpensive and accurate, and a woman ordinarily discovers\nshe is pregnant by six weeks of gestation. See A. Branum\n& K. Ahrens, Trends in Timing of Pregnancy Awareness\nAmong US Women, 21 Maternal & Child Health J. 715, 722\n\n10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nROBERTS, C.

Safe and effective abortifa-\ncients, moreover, are now readily available, particularly\nduring those early stages. See I. Adibi et al., Abortion, 22\nGeo. J. Gender & L. 279, 303 (2021). Given all this, it is no\nsurprise that the vast majority of abortions happen in the\nfirst trimester. See Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, Abortion Surveillance\u2014United States 1 (2020).\nPresumably most of the remainder would also take place\nearlier if later abortions were not a legal option. Ample ev-\nidence thus suggests that a 15-week ban provides sufficient\ntime, absent rare circumstances, for a woman \u201cto decide for\nherself \u201d whether to terminate her pregnancy. Webster, 492\nU. S., at 520 (plurality opinion).*\nIII\nWhether a precedent should be overruled is a question\n\u201centirely within the discretion of the court.\u201d Hertz v. Wood-\nman, 218 U.

In my respectful view, the sound exercise of that dis-\ncretion should have led the Court to resolve the case on the\nnarrower grounds set forth above, rather than overruling\nRoe and Casey entirely.

See Pet.\nfor Cert. 15\u201326; Brief for Petitioners 5, 38\u201348 (urging the Court to reject\nthe viability rule and reverse); Reply Brief 20\u201322 (same). The approach\nalso finds support in prior opinions. See Webster, 492 U. S., at 518\u2013521\n(plurality opinion) (abandoning \u201ckey elements\u201d of the Roe framework un-\nder stare decisis while declining to reconsider Roe\u2019s holding that the Con-\nstitution protects the right to an abortion).\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 11\nROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\nThe Court\u2019s decision to overrule Roe and Casey is a seri-\nous jolt to the legal system\u2014regardless of how you view\nthose cases. A narrower decision rejecting the misguided\nviability line would be markedly less unsettling, and noth-\ning more is needed to decide this case.\nOur cases say that the effect of overruling a precedent on\nreliance interests is a factor to consider in deciding whether\nto take such a step, and respondents argue that generations\nof women have relied on the right to an abortion in organ-\nizing their relationships and planning their futures. Brief\nfor Respondents 36\u201341; see also Casey, 505 U. S., at 856\n(making the same point). The Court questions whether\nthese concerns are pertinent under our precedents, see\nante, at 64\u201365, but the issue would not even arise with a\ndecision rejecting only the viability line: It cannot reasona-\nbly be argued that women have shaped their lives in part\non the assumption that they would be able to abort up to\nviability, as opposed to fifteen weeks.\nIn support of its holding, the Court cites three seminal\nconstitutional decisions that involved overruling prior prec-\nedents: Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954),\nWest Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943),\nand West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937).\nSee ante, at 40\u201341. The opinion in Brown was unanimous\nand eleven pages long; this one is neither. Barnette was\ndecided only three years after the decision it overruled,\nthree Justices having had second thoughts. And West Coast\nHotel was issued against a backdrop of unprecedented eco-\nnomic despair that focused attention on the fundamental\nflaws of existing precedent. It also was part of a sea change\nin this Court\u2019s interpretation of the Constitution, \u201csig-\nnal[ing] the demise of an entire line of important prece-\ndents,\u201d ante, at 40\u2014a feature the Court expressly disclaims\nin today\u2019s decision, see ante, at 32, 66. None of these lead-\ning cases, in short, provides a template for what the Court\ndoes today.\n\n12 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\nThe Court says we should consider whether to overrule\nRoe and Casey now, because if we delay we would be forced\nto consider the issue again in short order. See ante, at 76\u2013\n77. There would be \u201cturmoil\u201d until we did so, according to\nthe Court, because of existing state laws with \u201cshorter\ndeadlines or no deadline at all.\u201d Ante, at 76.

Illinois Central\nR. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 372\u2013373 (1955) (Frankfurter, J., for\nthe Court). I would decide the question we granted review\nto answer\u2014whether the previously recognized abortion\nright bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability, such\nthat a ban on abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy is\nnecessarily unlawful. The answer to that question is no,\nand there is no need to go further to decide this case.\nI therefore concur only in the judgment.\n\nCite as: 597 U.

Respecting a\nwoman as an autonomous being, and granting her full\nequality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most\npersonal and most consequential of all life decisions.\nRoe and Casey well understood the difficulty and divisive-\nness of the abortion issue. The Court knew that Americans\nhold profoundly different views about the \u201cmoral[ity]\u201d of\n\u201cterminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage.\u201d Ca-\nsey, 505 U. S., at 850. And the Court recognized that \u201cthe\n\n2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nBREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting\nState has legitimate interests from the outset of the preg-\nnancy in protecting\u201d the \u201clife of the fetus that may become\na child.\u201d Id., at 846. So the Court struck a balance, as it\noften does when values and goals compete. It held that the\nState could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long\nas the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a woman\u2019s life\nor health. It held that even before viability, the State could\nregulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful\nways. But until the viability line was crossed, the Court\nheld, a State could not impose a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d on a\nwoman\u2019s \u201cright to elect the procedure\u201d as she (not the gov-\nernment) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances\nand complexities of her own life. Ibid.\nToday, the Court discards that balance. It says that from\nthe very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to\nspeak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term,\neven at the steepest personal and familial costs. An abor-\ntion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever\nrational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the law. And\nbecause, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life\nis rational, States will feel free to enact all manner of re-\nstrictions. The Mississippi law at issue here bars abortions\nafter the 15th week of pregnancy. Under the majority\u2019s rul-\ning, though, another State\u2019s law could do so after ten weeks,\nor five or three or one\u2014or, again, from the moment of ferti-\nlization. States have already passed such laws, in anticipa-\ntion of today\u2019s ruling. More will follow. Some States have\nenacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure,\nincluding taking medication in one\u2019s own home. They have\npassed laws without any exceptions for when the woman is\nthe victim of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman\nwill have to bear her rapist\u2019s child or a young girl her fa-\nther\u2019s\u2014no matter if doing so will destroy her life.

Across a\nvast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose\nits moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to\na child.\nEnforcement of all these draconian restrictions will also\nbe left largely to the States\u2019 devices. A State can of course\nimpose criminal penalties on abortion providers, including\nlengthy prison sentences. But some States will not stop\nthere. Perhaps, in the wake of today\u2019s decision, a state law\nwill criminalize the woman\u2019s conduct too, incarcerating or\nfining her for daring to seek or obtain an abortion. And as\nTexas has recently shown, a State can turn neighbor\nagainst neighbor, enlisting fellow citizens in the effort to\nroot out anyone who tries to get an abortion, or to assist\nanother in doing so.\nThe majority tries to hide the geographically expansive\neffects of its holding.

Some may criminalize\nefforts, including the provision of information or funding, to\nhelp women gain access to other States\u2019 abortion services.\nMost threatening of all, no language in today\u2019s decision\nstops the Federal Government from prohibiting abortions\nnationwide, once again from the moment of conception and\nwithout exceptions for rape or incest.

S., at 856. But no longer. As\nof today, this Court holds, a State can always force a woman\nto give birth, prohibiting even the earliest abortions. A\nState can thus transform what, when freely undertaken, is\na wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare.\nSome women, especially women of means, will find ways\naround the State\u2019s assertion of power. Others\u2014those with-\nout money or childcare or the ability to take time off from\nwork\u2014will not be so fortunate. Maybe they will try an un-\nsafe method of abortion, and come to physical harm, or even\ndie. Maybe they will undergo pregnancy and have a child,\nbut at significant personal or familial cost. At the least,\nthey will incur the cost of losing control of their lives. The\nConstitution will, today\u2019s majority holds, provide no shield,\ndespite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all.\nAnd no one should be confident that this majority is done\nwith its work. The right Roe and Casey recognized does not\nstand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for\ndecades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity,\nfamilial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the\nright to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the\nright to purchase and use contraception. See Griswold v.\nConnecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405\nU. S. 438 (1972). In turn, those rights led, more recently,\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 5\nBREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting\nto rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. See Lawrence\nv. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003); Obergefell v. Hodges, 576\nU. S. 644 (2015). They are all part of the same constitu-\ntional fabric, protecting autonomous decisionmaking over\nthe most personal of life decisions. The majority (or to be\nmore accurate, most of it) is eager to tell us today that noth-\ning it does \u201ccast[s] doubt on precedents that do not concern\nabortion.\u201d Ante, at 66; cf. ante, at 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring)\n(advocating the overruling of Griswold, Lawrence, and\nObergefell). But how could that be? The lone rationale for\nwhat the majority does today is that the right to elect an\nabortion is not \u201cdeeply rooted in history\u201d: Not until Roe, the\nmajority argues, did people think abortion fell within the\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of liberty. Ante, at 32. The same\ncould be said, though, of most of the rights the majority\nclaims it is not tampering with.

Or if it does,\nall rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-\n19th century are insecure. Either the mass of the majority\u2019s\nopinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are\nunder threat. It is one or the other.\nOne piece of evidence on that score seems especially sa-\nlient: The majority\u2019s cavalier approach to overturning this\nCourt\u2019s precedents. Stare decisis is the Latin phrase for a\nfoundation stone of the rule of law: that things decided\nshould stay decided unless there is a very good reason for\nchange. It is a doctrine of judicial modesty and humility.\nThose qualities are not evident in today\u2019s opinion. The ma-\njority has no good reason for the upheaval in law and society\nit sets off. Roe and Casey have been the law of the land for\ndecades, shaping women\u2019s expectations of their choices\nwhen an unplanned pregnancy occurs. Women have relied\n\n6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nBREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting\non the availability of abortion both in structuring their re-\nlationships and in planning their lives. The legal frame-\nwork Roe and Casey developed to balance the competing in-\nterests in this sphere has proved workable in courts across\nthe country. No recent developments, in either law or fact,\nhave eroded or cast doubt on those precedents. Nothing, in\nshort, has changed. Indeed, the Court in Casey already\nfound all of that to be true. Casey is a precedent about prec-\nedent. It reviewed the same arguments made here in sup-\nport of overruling Roe, and it found that doing so was not\nwarranted. The Court reverses course today for one reason\nand one reason only: because the composition of this Court\nhas changed. Stare decisis, this Court has often said, \u201ccon-\ntributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial\nprocess\u201d by ensuring that decisions are \u201cfounded in the law\nrather than in the proclivities of individuals.\u201d Payne v. Ten-\nnessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991); Vasquez v. Hillery, 474\nU. S. 254, 265 (1986). Today, the proclivities of individuals\nrule. The Court departs from its obligation to faithfully and\nimpartially apply the law. We dissent.\nI\nWe start with Roe and Casey, and with their deep connec-\ntions to a broad swath of this Court\u2019s precedents.

Id., at 851 (emphasis deleted). So too, Casey rea-\nsoned, the liberty clause protects the decision of a woman\nconfronting an unplanned pregnancy. Her decision about\nabortion was central, in the same way, to her capacity to\nchart her life\u2019s course. See id., at 853.\nIn reaffirming the right Roe recognized, the Court took\nfull account of the diversity of views on abortion, and the\nimportance of various competing state interests. Some\nAmericans, the Court stated, \u201cdeem [abortion] nothing\nshort of an act of violence against innocent human life.\u201d 505\nU. S., at 852. And each State has an interest in \u201cthe protec-\ntion of potential life\u201d\u2014as Roe itself had recognized. 505\nU. S., at 871 (plurality opinion). On the one hand, that in-\nterest was not conclusive. The State could not \u201cresolve\u201d the\n\u201cmoral and spiritual\u201d questions raised by abortion in \u201csuch\na definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the mat-\nter.\u201d Id., at 850 (majority opinion).

But on the other hand, the State had,\nas Roe had held, an exceptionally significant interest in dis-\nallowing abortions in the later phase of a pregnancy. And\nit had an ever-present interest in \u201censur[ing] that the\nwoman\u2019s choice is informed\u201d and in presenting the case for\n\u201cchoos[ing] childbirth over abortion.\u201d 505 U.

The majority would allow States to ban abor-\ntion from conception onward because it does not think\nforced childbirth at all implicates a woman\u2019s rights to equal-\nity and freedom. Today\u2019s Court, that is, does not think\nthere is anything of constitutional significance attached to\na woman\u2019s control of her body and the path of her life. Roe\nand Casey thought that one-sided view misguided. In some\nsense, that is the difference in a nutshell between our prec-\nedents and the majority opinion. The constitutional regime\nwe have lived in for the last 50 years recognized competing\ninterests, and sought a balance between them. The consti-\ntutional regime we enter today erases the woman\u2019s interest\nand recognizes only the State\u2019s (or the Federal Govern-\nment\u2019s).\nB\nThe majority makes this change based on a single ques-\ntion: Did the reproductive right recognized in Roe and Casey\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nof any significance.\u201d Ante, at 38. To the contrary. The liberty interests\nunderlying those rights are, as we will describe, quite similar. See infra,\nat 22\u201324. But only in the sphere of abortion is the state interest in pro-\ntecting potential life involved. So only in that sphere, as both Roe and\nCasey recognized, may a State impinge so far on the liberty interest (bar-\nring abortion after viability and discouraging it before). The majority\u2019s\nfailure to understand this fairly obvious point stems from its rejection of\nthe idea of balancing interests in this (or maybe in any) constitutional\ncontext. Cf. New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S.\n___, ___, ___\u2013___ (2022) (slip op., at 8, 15\u201317).

The majority says (and with this\nmuch we agree) that the answer to this question is no: In\n1868, there was no nationwide right to end a pregnancy,\nand no thought that the Fourteenth Amendment provided\none.\nOf course, the majority opinion refers as well to some\nlater and earlier history. On the one side of 1868, it goes\nback as far as the 13th (the 13th!) century. See ante, at 17.\nBut that turns out to be wheel-spinning.

When the\nmajority says that we must read our foundational charter\nas viewed at the time of ratification (except that we may\nalso check it against the Dark Ages), it consigns women to\nsecond-class citizenship.\nCasey itself understood this point, as will become clear.\nSee infra, at 23\u201324. It recollected with dismay a decision\nthis Court issued just five years after the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s ratification, approving a State\u2019s decision to\ndeny a law license to a woman and suggesting as well that\na woman had no legal status apart from her husband. See\n505 U. S., at 896\u2013897 (majority opinion) (citing Bradwell v.\nState, 16 Wall. 130 (1873)). \u201cThere was a time,\u201d Casey ex-\nplained, when the Constitution did not protect \u201cmen and\nwomen alike.\u201d 505 U. S., at 896. But times had changed.\nA woman\u2019s place in society had changed, and constitutional\nlaw had changed along with it. The relegation of women to\ninferior status in either the public sphere or the family was\n\u201cno longer consistent with our understanding\u201d of the Con-\nstitution. Id., at 897. Now, \u201c[t]he Constitution protects all\nindividuals, male or female,\u201d from \u201cthe abuse of governmen-\ntal power\u201d or \u201cunjustified state interference.\u201d Id., at 896,\n898.\nSo how is it that, as Casey said, our Constitution, read\n\n16 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nBREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting\nnow, grants rights to women, though it did not in 1868?\nHow is it that our Constitution subjects discrimination\nagainst them to heightened judicial scrutiny?",

How is it that\nuntil today, that same constitutional clause protected a\nwoman\u2019s right, in the event contraception failed, to end a\npregnancy in its earlier stages?\nThe answer is that this Court has rejected the majority\u2019s\npinched view of how to read our Constitution. \u201cThe Found-\ners,\u201d we recently wrote, \u201cknew they were writing a docu-\nment designed to apply to ever-changing circumstances\nover centuries.\u201d NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U. S. 513,\n533\u2013534 (2014). Or in the words of the great Chief Justice\nJohn Marshall, our Constitution is \u201cintended to endure for\nages to come,\u201d and must adapt itself to a future \u201cseen\ndimly,\u201d if at all. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415\n(1819). That is indeed why our Constitution is written as it\nis. The Framers (both in 1788 and 1868) understood that\nthe world changes. So they did not define rights by refer-\nence to the specific practices existing at the time. Instead,\nthe Framers defined rights in general terms, to permit fu-\nture evolution in their scope and meaning. And over the\ncourse of our history, this Court has taken up the Framers\u2019\ninvitation. It has kept true to the Framers\u2019 principles by\napplying them in new ways, responsive to new societal un-\nderstandings and conditions.\nNowhere has that approach been more prevalent than in\nconstruing the majestic but open-ended words of the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2014the guarantees of \u201cliberty\u201d and\n\u201cequality\u201d for all. And nowhere has that approach produced\nprouder moments, for this country and the Court. Consider\nan example Obergefell used a few years ago. The Court\n\nCite as: 597 U.

For now, our point is different: It is that\napplications of liberty and equality can evolve while re-\nmaining grounded in constitutional principles, constitu-\ntional history, and constitutional precedents. The second\nJustice Harlan discussed how to strike the right balance\nwhen he explained why he would have invalidated a State\u2019s\nban on contraceptive use.

It noted decisions protecting\nthe right to marry, including to someone of another race.\nSee id., at 847\u2013848 (\u201c[I]nterracial marriage was illegal in\nmost States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt\ncorrect in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected\nagainst state interference\u201d). In reviewing decades and dec-\nades of constitutional law, Casey could draw but one conclu-\nsion: Whatever was true in 1868, \u201c[i]t is settled now, as it\nwas when the Court heard arguments in Roe v. Wade, that\nthe Constitution places limits on a State\u2019s right to interfere\nwith a person\u2019s most basic decisions about family and\nparenthood.\u201d Id., at 849.\nAnd that conclusion still held good, until the Court\u2019s in-\ntervention here. It was settled at the time of Roe, settled at\nthe time of Casey, and settled yesterday that the Constitu-\ntion places limits on a State\u2019s power to assert control over\nan individual\u2019s body and most personal decisionmaking. A\nmultitude of decisions supporting that principle led to Roe\u2019s\nrecognition and Casey\u2019s reaffirmation of the right to choose;\nand Roe and Casey in turn supported additional protections\nfor intimate and familial relations.

We could go on\u2014and in fact we will. Suppose\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH were to say (in line with the majority\nopinion) that the rights we just listed are more textually or\nhistorically grounded than the right to choose. What, then,\nof the right to contraception or same-sex marriage? Would\nit be \u201cscrupulously neutral\u201d for the Court to eliminate those\nrights too? The point of all these examples is that when it\ncomes to rights, the Court does not act \u201cneutrally\u201d when it\nleaves everything up to the States. Rather, the Court acts\nneutrally when it protects the right against all comers.

Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891); see\nCruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 269\n(1990) (Every adult \u201chas a right to determine what shall be\ndone with his own body\u201d). Or to put it more simply: Every-\none, including women, owns their own bodies. So the Court\nhas restricted the power of government to interfere with a\nperson\u2019s medical decisions or compel her to undergo medical\nprocedures or treatments. See, e.g., Winston v. Lee, 470\nU. S. 753, 766\u2013767 (1985) (forced surgery); Rochin v. Cali-\nfornia, 342 U. S. 165, 166, 173\u2013174 (1952) (forced stomach\npumping); Washington v. Harper, 494 U.

And that doctrinal\naffinity is born of a factual likeness. There are few greater\nincursions on a body than forcing a woman to complete a\npregnancy and give birth. For every woman, those experi-\nences involve all manner of physical changes, medical treat-\nments (including the possibility of a cesarean section), and\n\n22 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nBREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting\nmedical risk. Just as one example, an American woman is\n14 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term\nthan by having an abortion. See Whole Woman\u2019s Health v.\nHellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582, 618 (2016). That women happily\nundergo those burdens and hazards of their own accord\ndoes not lessen how far a State impinges on a woman\u2019s body\nwhen it compels her to bring a pregnancy to term. And for\nsome women, as Roe recognized, abortions are medically\nnecessary to prevent harm. See 410 U. S., at 153. The ma-\njority does not say\u2014which is itself ominous\u2014whether a\nState may prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion\nwhen she and her doctor have determined it is a needed\nmedical treatment.\nSo too, Roe and Casey fit neatly into a long line of deci-\nsions protecting from government intrusion a wealth of pri-\nvate choices about family matters, child rearing, intimate\nrelationships, and procreation. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 851,\n857; Roe, 410 U. S., at 152\u2013153; see also ante, at 31\u201332 (list-\ning the myriad decisions of this kind that Casey relied on).",

See, e.g., Loving, 388 U. S. 1 (interracial cou-\nples); Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987) (prisoners); see\nalso, e.g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651\u2013652 (1972)\n(offering constitutional protection to untraditional \u201cfamily\nunit[s]\u201d). And after Roe and Casey, of course, the Court con-\ntinued in that vein. With a critical stop to hold that the\nFourteenth Amendment protected same-sex intimacy, the\nCourt resolved that the Amendment also conferred on\nsame-sex couples the right to marry. See Lawrence, 539\nU. S. 558; Obergefell, 576 U. S. 644. In considering that\nquestion, the Court held, \u201c[h]istory and tradition,\u201d espe-\ncially as reflected in the course of our precedent, \u201cguide and\ndiscipline [the] inquiry.\u201d Id., at 664. But the sentiments of\n1868 alone do not and cannot \u201crule the present.\u201d Ibid.\nCasey similarly recognized the need to extend the consti-\ntutional sphere of liberty to a previously excluded group.\nThe Court then understood, as the majority today does not,\nthat the men who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and\nwrote the state laws of the time did not view women as full\nand equal citizens. See supra, at 15. A woman then, Casey\nwrote, \u201chad no legal existence separate from her husband.\u201d\n505 U. S., at 897.",

Over the course of three cases, the Court had held\nthat a right to use and gain access to contraception was part\nof the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of liberty. See\nGriswold, 381 U. S. 479; Eisenstadt, 405 U. S. 438; Carey v.\nPopulation Services Int\u2019l, 431 U. S. 678 (1977).

Or at least that is so\nif the majority is serious about its sole reason for overturn-\ning Roe and Casey: the legal status of abortion in the 19th\ncentury. Except in the places quoted above, the state inter-\nest in protecting fetal life plays no part in the majority\u2019s\nanalysis. To the contrary, the majority takes pride in not\nexpressing a view \u201cabout the status of the fetus.\u201d Ante, at\n65; see ante, at 32 (aligning itself with Roe\u2019s and Casey\u2019s\nstance of not deciding whether life or potential life is in-\nvolved); ante, at 38\u201339 (similar). The majority\u2019s departure\nfrom Roe and Casey rests instead\u2014and only\u2014on whether a\nwoman\u2019s decision to end a pregnancy involves any Four-\nteenth Amendment liberty interest (against which Roe and\nCasey balanced the state interest in preserving fetal life).7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n7Indulge a few more words about this point. The majority had a choice\nof two different ways to overrule Roe and Casey. It could claim that those\ncases underrated the State\u2019s interest in fetal life. Or it could claim that\nthey overrated a woman\u2019s constitutional liberty interest in choosing an\nabortion. (Or both.) The majority here rejects the first path, and we can\nsee why. Taking that route would have prevented the majority from\nclaiming that it means only to leave this issue to the democratic pro-\ncess\u2014that it does not have a dog in the fight. See ante, at 38\u201339, 65.\nAnd indeed, doing so might have suggested a revolutionary proposition:\nthat the fetus is itself a constitutionally protected \u201cperson,\u201d such that an\nabortion ban is constitutionally mandated. The majority therefore\nchooses the second path, arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment does\n\nCite as: 597 U.

But the majority gives no hint as to why. And the\nmajority\u2019s (mis)treatment of stare decisis in this case provides little rea-\nson to think that the doctrine would stand as a barrier to the majority\u2019s\nredoing any other decision it considered egregiously wrong.

It has considered fundamental constitutional princi-\nples, the whole course of the Nation\u2019s history and traditions,\nand the step-by-step evolution of the Court\u2019s precedents. It\nis disciplined but not static. It relies on accumulated judg-\nments, not just the sentiments of one long-ago generation\nof men (who themselves believed, and drafted the Constitu-\ntion to reflect, that the world progresses).

Be-\ncause those laws prevented women from charting the\ncourse of their own lives, the majority says States can do\nthe same again. Because in 1868, the government could tell\na pregnant woman\u2014even in the first days of her preg-\nnancy\u2014that she could do nothing but bear a child, it can\nonce more impose that command.

But none does, as further described below and\nin the Appendix. See infra, at 61\u201366. In some, the Court\nonly partially modified or clarified a precedent. And in the\nrest, the Court relied on one or more of the traditional stare\ndecisis factors in reaching its conclusion. The Court found,\nfor example, (1) a change in legal doctrine that undermined\nor made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change\nthat had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance be-\ncause the earlier decision was less than a decade old. (The\nmajority is wrong when it says that we insist on a test of\nchanged law or fact alone, although that is present in most\nof the cases. See ante, at 69.) None of those factors apply\nhere: Nothing\u2014and in particular, no significant legal or fac-\ntual change\u2014supports overturning a half-century of settled\nlaw giving women control over their reproductive lives.\nFirst, for all the reasons we have given, Roe and Casey\nwere correct. In holding that a State could not \u201cresolve\u201d the\ndebate about abortion \u201cin such a definitive way that a\nwoman lacks all choice in the matter,\u201d the Court protected\nwomen\u2019s liberty and women\u2019s equality in a way comporting\nwith our Fourteenth Amendment precedents.

After assessing the traditional stare deci-\nsis factors, Casey reached the only conclusion possible\u2014\nthat stare decisis operates powerfully here.

So under\ntraditional stare decisis principles, the majority has no spe-\ncial justification for the harm it causes.\nAnd indeed, the majority comes close to conceding that\npoint.

It does not. It makes radical change too easy and\ntoo fast, based on nothing more than the new views of new\njudges. The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one\nand only one reason: because it has always despised them,\nand now it has the votes to discard them.

As\nfor lower courts, there is now a one-year-old, one-to-one Cir-\ncuit split about how the undue burden standard applies to\nstate laws that ban abortions for certain reasons, like fetal\nabnormality.

Casey, 505 U. S., at 857. Roe and Casey have\nthemselves formed the legal foundation for subsequent de-\ncisions protecting these profoundly personal choices. As\ndiscussed earlier, the Court relied on Casey to hold that the\nFourteenth Amendment protects same-sex intimate rela-\ntionships. See Lawrence, 539 U.

The ma-\njority briefly refers to arguments about changes in laws re-\nlating to healthcare coverage, pregnancy discrimination,\nand family leave. See ante, at 33\u201334. Many women, how-\never, still do not have adequate healthcare coverage before\nand after pregnancy; and, even when insurance coverage is\navailable, healthcare services may be far away.14 Women\nalso continue to face pregnancy discrimination that inter-\nferes with their ability to earn a living.

Reed, 404 U. S. 71, 76 (1971) (recog-\nnizing that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits sex-based\ndiscrimination). By 1992, when the Court decided Casey,\nthe traditional view of a woman\u2019s role as only a wife and\nmother was \u201cno longer consistent with our understanding\nof the family, the individual, or the Constitution.\u201d 505\nU.

And for that to happen, women must have\ncontrol over their reproductive decisions. Nothing since Ca-\nsey\u2014no changed law, no changed fact\u2014has undermined\nthat promise.\nC\nThe reasons for retaining Roe and Casey gain further\nstrength from the overwhelming reliance interests those\ndecisions have created.

For half a century now, in Casey\u2019s words, \u201c[t]he\nability of women to participate equally in the economic and\nsocial life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability\nto control their reproductive lives.\u201d Ibid.; see supra, at 23\u2013\n24. Indeed, all women now of childbearing age have grown\nup expecting that they would be able to avail themselves of\nRoe\u2019s and Casey\u2019s protections.\nThe disruption of overturning Roe and Casey will there-\nfore be profound. Abortion is a common medical procedure\nand a familiar experience in women\u2019s lives. About 18 per-\ncent of pregnancies in this country end in abortion, and\nabout one quarter of American women will have an abortion\nbefore the age of 45.22 Those numbers reflect the predicta-\nble and life-changing effects of carrying a pregnancy, giving\nbirth, and becoming a parent. As Casey understood, people\ntoday rely on their ability to control and time pregnancies\nwhen making countless life decisions: where to live,\nwhether and how to invest in education or careers, how to\nallocate financial resources, and how to approach intimate\nand family relationships.

S.,\nat 443 (recognizing that Miranda \u201cwarnings have become\npart of our national culture\u201d in declining to overrule Mi-\nranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966)). Rescinding an in-\ndividual right in its entirety and conferring it on the State,\nan action the Court takes today for the first time in history,\naffects all who have relied on our constitutional system of\ngovernment and its structure of individual liberties pro-\ntected from state oversight. Roe and Casey have of course\naroused controversy and provoked disagreement. But the\nright those decisions conferred and reaffirmed is part of so-\nciety\u2019s understanding of constitutional law and of how the\nCourt has defined the liberty and equality that women are\nentitled to claim.\nAfter today, young women will come of age with fewer\n\nCite as: 597 U.

The ma-\njority accomplishes that result without so much as consid-\nering how women have relied on the right to choose or what\nit means to take that right away. The majority\u2019s refusal\neven to consider the life-altering consequences of reversing\nRoe and Casey is a stunning indictment of its decision.\nD\nOne last consideration counsels against the majority\u2019s\nruling: the very controversy surrounding Roe and Casey.\nThe majority accuses Casey of acting outside the bounds of\nthe law to quell the conflict over abortion\u2014of imposing an\nunprincipled \u201csettlement\u201d of the issue in an effort to end\n\u201cnational division.\u201d Ante, at 67. But that is not what Casey\ndid. As shown above, Casey applied traditional principles\nof stare decisis\u2014which the majority today ignores\u2014in reaf-\nfirming Roe. Casey carefully assessed changed circum-\nstances (none) and reliance interests (profound). It consid-\nered every aspect of how Roe\u2019s framework operated. It\nadhered to the law in its analysis, and it reached the con-\nclusion that the law required. True enough that Casey took\nnotice of the \u201cnational controversy\u201d about abortion: The\nCourt knew in 1992, as it did in 1973, that abortion was a\n\u201cdivisive issue.\u201d Casey, 505 U.

And it seems to us\nright. The majority responds (if we understand it correctly):\nwell, yes, but we have to apply the law. See ante, at 67. To\nwhich Casey would have said: That is exactly the point.\nHere, more than anywhere, the Court needs to apply the\nlaw\u2014particularly the law of stare decisis. Here, we know\nthat citizens will continue to contest the Court\u2019s decision,\nbecause \u201c[m]en and women of good conscience\u201d deeply disa-\ngree about abortion. Casey, 505 U. S., at 850. When that\ncontestation takes place\u2014but when there is no legal basis\nfor reversing course\u2014the Court needs to be steadfast, to\nstand its ground. That is what the rule of law requires.\nAnd that is what respect for this Court depends on.\n\u201cThe promise of constancy, once given\u201d in so charged an\nenvironment, Casey explained, \u201cbinds its maker for as long\nas\u201d the \u201cunderstanding of the issue has not changed so fun-\ndamentally as to render the commitment obsolete.\u201d Id., at\n868.

Weakening\nstare decisis threatens to upend bedrock legal doctrines, far\nbeyond any single decision. Weakening stare decisis creates\nprofound legal instability. And as Casey recognized, weak-\nening stare decisis in a hotly contested case like this one\ncalls into question this Court\u2019s commitment to legal princi-\nple. It makes the Court appear not restrained but aggres-\nsive, not modest but grasping. In all those ways, today\u2019s\ndecision takes aim, we fear, at the rule of law.\nIII\n\u201cPower, not reason, is the new currency of this Court\u2019s\ndecisionmaking.\u201d Payne, 501 U.

And the doctrine of stare decisis\u2014a critical ele-\nment of the rule of law\u2014stands foursquare behind their\ncontinued existence. The right those decisions established\nand preserved is embedded in our constitutional law, both\noriginating in and leading to other rights protecting bodily\nintegrity, personal autonomy, and family relationships.\nThe abortion right is also embedded in the lives of women\u2014\nshaping their expectations, influencing their choices about\nrelationships and work, supporting (as all reproductive\nrights do) their social and economic equality. Since the\nright\u2019s recognition (and affirmation), nothing has changed\nto support what the majority does today. Neither law nor\nfacts nor attitudes have provided any new reasons to reach\na different result than Roe and Casey did. All that has\nchanged is this Court.\nMississippi\u2014and other States too\u2014knew exactly what\nthey were doing in ginning up new legal challenges to Roe\nand Casey. The 15-week ban at issue here was enacted in\n2018. Other States quickly followed: Between 2019 and\n2021, eight States banned abortion procedures after six to\n\n58 DOBBS v.
