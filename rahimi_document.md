UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 22–915.  Argued November 7, 2023—Decided June 21, 2024

Respondent Zackey Rahimi was indicted under 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(8), a
federal statute that prohibits individuals subject to a domestic violence
restraining order from possessing a firearm.  A prosecution under Sec-
tion 922(g)(8) may proceed only if the restraining order meets certain
statutory criteria.  In particular, the order must either contain a find-
ing  that  the  defendant  “represents  a  credible  threat  to  the  physical
safety”  of  his  intimate  partner  or  his  or  his  partner’s  child,
§922(g)(8)(C)(i),  or  “by  its  terms  explicitly  prohibit[ ]  the  use,”  at-
tempted use, or threatened use of “physical force” against those indi-
viduals, §922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  Rahimi concedes here that the restraining
order against him satisfies the statutory criteria, but argues that on
its face Section 922(g)(8) violates the Second Amendment.  The District
Court  denied  Rahimi’s  motion  to  dismiss  the  indictment  on  Second
Amendment  grounds.    While  Rahimi’s  case  was  on  appeal,  the  Su-
preme Court decided New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen,
597 U. S. 1 (2022).  In light of Bruen, the Fifth Circuit reversed, con-
cluding that the Government had not shown that Section 922(g)(8) “fits
within our Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”  61 F.
4th 443, 460 (CA5 2023).

Held: When an individual has been found by a court to pose a credible
threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may be tempo-
rarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment.  Pp. 5–17.

(a) Since the Founding, the Nation’s firearm laws have included reg-
ulations to stop individuals who threaten physical harm to others from
misusing firearms.  As applied to the facts here, Section 922(g)(8) fits
within this tradition.

The right to keep and bear arms is among the “fundamental rights
necessary to our system of ordered liberty.”  McDonald v. Chicago, 561

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

Syllabus

U. S. 742, 778.  That right, however, “is not unlimited,” District of Co-
lumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 626.  The reach of the Second Amend-
ment is not limited only to  those arms that were in existence at the
Founding.  Heller, 554 U. S., at 582.  Rather, it “extends, prima facie,
to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were
not [yet] in existence.”  Ibid.  By that same logic, the Second Amend-
ment permits more than just regulations identical to those existing in
1791.
Under  our  precedent,  the  appropriate  analysis  involves  considering
whether  the  challenged  regulation  is  consistent  with  the  principles
that underpin the Nation’s regulatory tradition.  Bruen, 597 U. S., at
26–31.    When  firearm  regulation  is  challenged  under  the  Second
Amendment, the Government must show that the restriction “is con-
sistent  with  the  Nation’s  historical  tradition  of  firearm  regulation.”
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 24.  A court must ascertain whether the new law
is “relevantly similar” to laws that our tradition is understood to per-
mit, “apply[ing] faithfully the balance struck by the founding genera-
tion to modern circumstances.”  Id., at 29, and n. 7.  Why and how the
regulation burdens the right are central to this inquiry.  As Bruen ex-
plained, a challenged regulation that does not precisely match its his-
torical  precursors  “still  may  be  analogous  enough  to  pass  constitu-
tional muster.”  Id., at 30.  Pp. 5–8.

(b) Section 922(g)(8) survives Rahimi’s challenge.  Pp. 8–17.

(1) Rahimi’s facial challenge to Section 922(g)(8) requires him to
“establish  that  no  set  of  circumstances  exists  under  which  the  Act
would be valid.”  United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745.  Here,
Section 922(g)(8) is constitutional as applied to the facts of Rahimi’s
own case.  Rahimi has been found by a court to pose a credible threat
to the physical safety of others, see §922(g)(8)(C)(i), and the Govern-
ment offers ample evidence that the Second Amendment permits such
individuals to be disarmed.  P. 8.

(2) The Court reviewed the history of American gun laws exten-
sively in Heller and Bruen.  At common law people were barred from
misusing weapons to harm or menace others.  Such conduct was often
addressed  through  ordinary  criminal  laws  and  civil  actions,  such  as
prohibitions  on  fighting  or  private  suits  against  individuals  who
threatened others.  By the 1700s and early 1800s, though, two distinct
legal regimes had developed that specifically addressed firearms vio-
lence: the surety laws and the “going armed” laws.  Surety laws were
a form of “preventive justice,” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England 251 (10th ed. 1787), which authorized magistrates to
require individuals suspected of future misbehavior to post a bond.  If
an individual failed to post a bond, he would be jailed.  If the individual
did post a bond and then broke the peace, the bond would be forfeit.

Syllabus

Surety laws could be invoked to prevent all forms of violence, including
spousal abuse, and also targeted the misuse of firearms.  These laws
often offered the accused significant procedural protections.

The “going armed” laws—a particular subset of the ancient common
law  prohibition  on  affrays,  or  fighting  in  public—provided  a  mecha-
nism for punishing those who had menaced others with firearms.  Un-
der  these  laws,  individuals  were  prohibited  from  “riding  or  going
armed, with dangerous or unusual weapons, [to] terrify[ ] the good peo-
ple of the land.”  4 Blackstone 149.  Those who did so faced forfeiture
of  their  arms  and  imprisonment.    Prohibitions  on  going  armed  were
incorporated  into  American  jurisprudence  through  the  common  law,
and some States expressly codified them.  Pp. 9–13.

(3) Together, the surety and going armed laws confirm what com-
mon sense suggests: When an individual poses a clear threat of physi-
cal violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed.
Section 922(g)(8) is not identical to these founding-era regimes, but it
does not need to be.  Like the surety and going armed laws, Section
922(g)(8)(C)(i) applies to individuals found by a court to threaten the
physical safety of another.  This prohibition is “relevantly similar” to
those founding era regimes in both why and how it burdens the Second
Amendment  right.  Id.,  at  29.  Section  922(g)(8)  restricts  gun  use  to
check demonstrated threats of physical violence, just as the surety and
going  armed  laws  do.  Unlike  the  regulation  struck  down  in  Bruen,
Section 922(g)(8) does not broadly restrict arms use by the public gen-
erally.

The burden that Section 922(g)(8) imposes on the right to bear arms
also fits within the Nation’s regulatory tradition.  While the Court does
not  suggest  that  the  Second  Amendment  prohibits  the  enactment  of
laws banning the possession of guns by categories of persons thought
by a legislature to present a special danger of misuse, see Heller, 554
U. S., at 626, Section 922(g)(8) applies only once a court has found that
the defendant “represents a credible threat to the physical safety” of
another,  §922(g)(8)(C)(i),  which  notably  matches  the  similar  judicial
determinations required in the surety and going armed laws.  Moreo-
ver, like surety bonds of limited duration, Section 922(g)(8) only pro-
hibits firearm possession so long as the defendant “is” subject to a re-
straining order.  Finally, the penalty—another relevant aspect of the
burden—also  fits  within  the  regulatory  tradition.    The  going  armed
laws provided for imprisonment, and if imprisonment was permissible
to respond to the use of guns to threaten the physical safety of others,
then  the  lesser  restriction  of  temporary  disarmament  that  Section
922(g)(8) imposes is also permissible.

The Court’s decisions in Heller and Bruen do not help Rahimi.  While
Section  922(g)(8)  bars  individuals  subject  to  restraining  orders  from

4

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

Syllabus

possessing  guns  in  the  home,  Heller  never  established  a  categorical
rule  that  the  Constitution  prohibits  regulations  that  forbid  firearm
possession in the home.  Indeed, Heller stated that many such prohi-
bitions, like those on the possession of firearms by “felons and the men-
tally  ill,”  are  “presumptively  lawful.”  Heller,  554  U. S.,  at  626,  627,
n. 26.  And the Court’s conclusion in Bruen that regulations like the
surety laws are not a proper historical analogue for a broad gun licens-
ing regime does not mean that they cannot be an appropriate analogue
for a narrow one. Pp. 13–15.

(4) The Fifth Circuit erred in reading Bruen to require a “histori-
cal  twin”  rather  than  a  “historical  analogue.”   597  U. S.,  at  30.   The
panel  also  misapplied  the  Court’s  precedents  when  evaluating
Rahimi’s facial challenge.  Rather than consider the circumstances in
which Section 922(g)(8) was most likely to be constitutional, the panel
instead focused on hypothetical scenarios where the provision might
raise constitutional concerns.  P. 16.

(5) Finally,  the  Court  rejects  the  Government’s  contention  that
Rahimi may be disarmed simply because he is not “responsible.”  The
Court used this term in Heller and Bruen to describe the class of citi-
zens who undoubtedly enjoy the Second Amendment right.  Those de-
cisions, however, did not define the term and said nothing about the
status of citizens who were not “responsible.”  P. 17.

UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[June 21, 2024]

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS  delivered  the  opinion  of  the

Court.

A federal statute prohibits an individual subject to a do-
mestic violence restraining order from possessing a firearm
if that order includes a finding that he “represents a credi-
ble threat to the physical safety of [an] intimate partner,”
or  a  child  of  the  partner  or  individual.
18  U. S. C.
§922(g)(8).  Respondent Zackey Rahimi is subject to such an
order.  The question is whether this provision may be en-
forced against him consistent with the Second Amendment.

I
A

In December 2019, Rahimi met his girlfriend, C. M., for
lunch in a parking lot.  C. M. is also the mother of Rahimi’s
young child, A. R.  During the meal, Rahimi and C. M. be-
gan arguing, and Rahimi became enraged.  Brief for United
States 2.  C. M. attempted to leave, but Rahimi grabbed her
by the wrist, dragged her back to his car, and shoved her in,
causing  her  to  strike  her  head  against  the  dashboard.
When he realized that a bystander was watching the alter-
cation, Rahimi paused to retrieve a gun from under the pas-

2

Opinion of the Court

senger seat.  C. M. took advantage of the opportunity to es-
cape.  Rahimi  fired  as  she  fled,  although  it  is  unclear
whether  he  was  aiming  at  C. M.  or  the  witness.  Rahimi
later called C. M. and warned that he would shoot her if she
reported the incident.  Ibid.

Undeterred by this threat, C. M. went to court to seek a
restraining order.  In the affidavit accompanying her appli-
cation, C. M. recounted the parking lot incident as well as
other assaults.  She also detailed how Rahimi’s conduct had
endangered A. R.  Although Rahimi had an opportunity to
contest C. M.’s testimony, he did not do so.  On February 5,
2020, a state court in Tarrant County, Texas, issued a re-
straining order against him.  The order, entered with the
consent of both parties, included a finding that Rahimi had
committed “family violence.”  App. 2.  It also found that this
violence was “likely to occur again” and that Rahimi posed
“a credible threat” to the “physical safety” of C. M. or A. R.
Id., at 2–3.  Based on these findings, the order prohibited
Rahimi from threatening C. M. or her family for two years
or  contacting  C. M.  during  that  period  except  to  discuss
A. R.  Id., at 3–7.  It also suspended Rahimi’s gun license
for  two  years.    Id.,  at  5–6.    If  Rahimi  was  imprisoned  or
confined when the order was set to expire, the order would
instead terminate either one or two years after his release
date, depending on the length of his imprisonment.  Id., at
6–7.

In May, however, Rahimi violated the order by approach-
ing  C. M.’s  home  at  night.    He  also  began  contacting  her
through several social media accounts.

In November, Rahimi threatened a different woman with
a gun, resulting in a charge for aggravated assault with a
deadly  weapon.    And  while  Rahimi  was  under  arrest  for
that assault, the Texas police identified him as the suspect
in a spate of at least five additional shootings.

The first, which occurred in December 2020, arose from
Rahimi’s dealing in illegal drugs.  After one of his customers

Opinion of the Court

“started  talking  trash,”  Rahimi  drove  to  the  man’s  home
and shot into it.  Brief for United States 3.  While driving
the next day, Rahimi collided with another car, exited his
vehicle, and proceeded to shoot at the other car.  Three days
later,  he  fired  his  gun  in  the  air  while  driving  through  a
residential neighborhood.  A few weeks after that, Rahimi
was speeding on a highway near Arlington, Texas, when a
truck flashed its lights at him.  Rahimi hit the brakes and
cut across traffic to chase the truck.  Once off the highway,
he  fired  several  times  toward  the  truck  and  a  nearby  car
before fleeing.  Two weeks after that, Rahimi and a friend
were dining at a roadside burger restaurant.  When the res-
taurant  declined  his  friend’s  credit  card,  Rahimi  pulled  a
gun and shot into the air.

The  police  obtained  a  warrant  to  search  Rahimi’s  resi-
dence.  There they discovered a pistol, a rifle, ammunition—
and a copy of the restraining order.

B
Rahimi was indicted on one count of possessing a firearm
while subject to a domestic violence restraining order, in vi-
olation of 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(8).  At the time, such a viola-
tion was punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment (since
amended  to  15  years).  §924(a)(2);  see  Bipartisan  Safer
Communities Act, Pub. L. 117–159, §12004(c)(2), 136 Stat.
1329, 18 U. S. C. §924(a)(8).  A prosecution under Section
922(g)(8) may proceed only if three criteria are met.  First,
the defendant must have received actual notice and an op-
portunity  to  be  heard  before  the  order  was  entered.
§922(g)(8)(A).  Second, the order must prohibit the defend-
ant  from  either  “harassing,  stalking,  or  threatening”  his
“intimate partner” or his or his partner’s child, or “engaging
in other conduct that would place [the] partner in reasona-
ble  fear  of  bodily  injury”  to  the  partner  or  child.
§922(g)(8)(B).  A defendant’s “intimate partner[s]” include
his spouse or any former spouse, the parent of his child, and

4

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

Opinion of the Court

anyone  with  whom  he  cohabitates  or  has  cohabitated.
§921(a)(32).  Third,  under  Section  922(g)(8)(C),  the  order
must  either  contain  a  finding  that  the  defendant  “repre-
sents a credible threat to the physical safety” of his intimate
partner or his or his partner’s child, §922(g)(8)(C)(i), or “by
its  terms  explicitly  prohibit[ ]  the  use,”  attempted  use,  or
threatened use of “physical force” against those individuals,
§922(g)(8)(C)(ii).

Rahimi’s restraining order met all three criteria.  First,
Rahimi had received notice and an opportunity to be heard
before  the  order  was  entered.    App.  2.    Second,  the  order
prohibited  him  from  communicating  with  or  threatening
C. M.  Id., at 3–4.  Third, the order met the requirements of
Section  922(g)(8)(C)(i),  because  it  included  a  finding  that
Rahimi  represented  “a  credible  threat  to  the  physical
safety” of C. M. or her family.  Id., at 2–3.  The order also
“explicitly  prohibit[ed]”  Rahimi  from  “the  use,  attempted
use, or threatened use of physical force” against C. M., sat-
isfying  the  independent  basis  for  liability  in  Section
922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  Id., at 3.

Rahimi  moved  to  dismiss  the  indictment,  arguing  that
Section  922(g)(8)  violated  on  its  face  the  Second  Amend-
ment right to keep and bear arms.  No. 4:21–cr–00083 (ND
Tex., May 7, 2021), ECF Doc. 17.  Concluding that Circuit
precedent  foreclosed  Rahimi’s  Second  Amendment  chal-
lenge, the District Court denied his motion.  Rahimi then
pleaded  guilty.  On  appeal,  he  again  raised  his  Second
Amendment challenge.  The appeal was denied, and Rahimi
petitioned for rehearing en banc.

While Rahimi’s petition was pending, this Court decided
New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S.
1 (2022).  In Bruen, we explained that when a firearm reg-
ulation  is  challenged  under  the  Second  Amendment,  the
Government  must  show  that  the  restriction  “is  consistent
with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
Id., at 24.

Opinion of the Court

In  light  of  Bruen,  the  panel  withdrew  the  prior  opinion
and ordered additional briefing.  A new panel then heard
oral argument and reversed.  61 F. 4th 443, 448 (CA5 2023).
Surveying  the  evidence  that  the  Government  had  identi-
fied, the panel concluded that Section 922(g)(8) does not fit
within our tradition of firearm regulation.  Id., at 460–461.
Judge  Ho  wrote  separately  to  express  his  view  that  the
panel’s ruling did not conflict with the interest in protecting
people from violent individuals.  Id., at 461–462 (concurring
opinion).

We granted certiorari. 600 U. S. ___ (2023)

II
When a restraining order contains a finding that an indi-
vidual poses a credible threat to the physical safety of an
intimate partner, that individual may—consistent with the
Second Amendment—be banned from possessing firearms
while the order is in effect.  Since the founding, our Nation’s
firearm laws have included provisions preventing individu-
als  who  threaten  physical  harm  to  others  from  misusing
firearms.  As  applied  to  the  facts  of  this  case,  Section
922(g)(8) fits comfortably within this tradition.

A
We  have  held  that  the  right  to  keep  and  bear  arms  is
among the “fundamental rights necessary to our system of
ordered liberty.”  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 778
(2010).  Derived from English practice and codified in the
Second  Amendment,  the  right  secures  for  Americans  a
means of self-defense.  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 17.  The spark
that ignited the American Revolution was struck at Lexing-
ton and Concord, when the British governor dispatched sol-
diers to seize the local farmers’ arms and powder stores.  In
the aftermath of the Civil War, Congress’s desire to enable
the newly freed slaves to defend themselves against former
Confederates helped inspire the passage of the Fourteenth

6

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

Opinion of the Court

Amendment, which secured the right to bear arms against
interference by the States.  McDonald,  561 U. S., at 771–
776.  As a leading and early proponent of emancipation ob-
served,  “Disarm  a  community  and  you  rob  them  of  the
means  of  defending  life.    Take  away  their  weapons  of  de-
fense and you take away the inalienable right of defending
liberty.”  Cong.  Globe,  40th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  1967  (1868)
(statement of Rep. Stevens).

“Like most rights,” though, “the right secured by the Sec-
ond Amendment is not unlimited.”  District of Columbia v.
Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 626 (2008).  In Heller, this Court held
that the right applied to ordinary citizens within the home.
Even as  we did so, however,  we recognized that the right
was never thought to sweep indiscriminately.  “From Black-
stone  through  the  19th-century  cases,  commentators  and
courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to
keep  and  carry  any  weapon  whatsoever  in  any  manner
whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”  Ibid.  At the found-
ing, the bearing of arms was subject to regulations ranging
from rules about firearm storage to restrictions on gun use
by drunken New Year’s Eve revelers.  Act of Mar. 1, 1783,
1783 Mass. Acts and Laws ch.13, pp. 218–219; 5 Colonial
Laws of New York ch. 1501, pp. 244–246 (1894).  Some ju-
risdictions banned the carrying of “dangerous and unusual
weapons.”  554 U. S., at 627 (citing 4 W. Blackstone, Com-
mentaries on the Laws of England 148–149 (1769)).  Others
forbade carrying concealed firearms.  554 U. S., at 626.

In  Heller,  our  inquiry  into  the  scope  of  the  right  began
with “constitutional text and history.”  Bruen, 597 U. S., at
22.  In Bruen, we directed courts to examine our “historical
tradition  of  firearm  regulation”  to  help  delineate  the  con-
tours of the right.  Id., at 17.  We explained that if a chal-
lenged regulation fits within that tradition, it is lawful un-
der  the  Second  Amendment.  We also  clarified  that  when
the Government regulates arms-bearing conduct, as when
the  Government  regulates  other  constitutional  rights,  it

Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)

7

Opinion of the Court

bears the burden to “justify its regulation.”  Id., at 24.

Nevertheless, some courts have misunderstood the meth-
odology  of  our  recent  Second  Amendment  cases.  These
precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in am-
ber.  As  we explained in Heller, for example,  the reach of
the  Second  Amendment  is  not  limited  only  to  those  arms
that were in existence at the founding.  554 U. S., at 582.
Rather, it “extends, prima facie, to all instruments that con-
stitute bearable arms, even those that were not [yet] in ex-
istence.”  Ibid.  By that same logic, the Second Amendment
permits more than just those regulations identical to ones
that could be found in 1791.  Holding otherwise would be as
mistaken  as  applying  the  protections  of  the  right  only  to
muskets and sabers.

As  we  explained  in  Bruen,  the  appropriate  analysis  in-
volves  considering  whether  the  challenged  regulation  is
consistent with the principles that underpin our regulatory
tradition.  597  U. S.,  at  26–31.    A  court  must  ascertain
whether the new law is “relevantly similar” to laws that our
tradition is understood to permit, “apply[ing] faithfully the
balance  struck  by  the  founding  generation  to  modern  cir-
cumstances.”  Id., at 29, and n. 7.  Discerning and develop-
ing the law in this way is “a commonplace task for any law-
yer or judge.”  Id., at 28.

Why and how the regulation burdens the right are cen-
tral to this inquiry.  Id., at 29.  For example, if laws at the
founding regulated firearm use to address particular prob-
lems, that will be a strong indicator that contemporary laws
imposing similar restrictions for similar reasons fall within
a permissible category of regulations.  Even when a law reg-
ulates  arms-bearing  for  a  permissible  reason,  though,  it
may not be compatible with the right if it does so to an ex-
tent beyond what was done at the founding.  And when a
challenged regulation does not precisely match its histori-
cal  precursors,  “it  still  may  be  analogous  enough  to  pass
constitutional muster.”  Id., at 30.  The law must comport

8

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

Opinion of the Court

with the principles underlying the Second Amendment, but
it need not be a “dead ringer” or a “historical twin.”  Ibid.
(emphasis deleted).1

B
Bearing these principles in mind, we conclude that Sec-

tion 922(g)(8) survives Rahimi’s challenge.

1

Rahimi challenges Section 922(g)(8) on its face.  This is
the  “most  difficult  challenge  to  mount  successfully,”  be-
cause it requires a defendant to “establish that no set of cir-
cumstances  exists  under  which  the  Act  would  be  valid.”
United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987).  That
means  that  to  prevail, the  Government  need only  demon-
strate that Section 922(g)(8) is constitutional in some of its
applications.  And here the provision is constitutional as ap-
plied to the facts of Rahimi’s own case.

Recall  that  Section  922(g)(8)  provides  two  independent
bases for liability.  Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i) bars an individual
from possessing a firearm if his restraining order includes
a  finding  that  he  poses  “a  credible  threat  to  the  physical
safety”  of  a  protected  person.
Separately,  Section
922(g)(8)(C)(ii)  bars  an  individual  from  possessing  a  fire-
arm if his restraining order “prohibits the use, attempted
use,  or  threatened  use  of  physical  force.”    Our  analysis
starts  and  stops  with  Section  922(g)(8)(C)(i)  because  the
Government offers ample evidence that the Second Amend-
ment  permits  the  disarmament  of  individuals  who  pose  a
credible threat to the physical safety of others.  We need not

decide whether regulation under Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) is
also permissible.

This Court reviewed the history of American gun laws ex-
tensively in Heller and Bruen.  From the earliest days of the
common law, firearm regulations have included provisions
barring people from misusing weapons to harm or menace
others.  The act of “go[ing] armed to terrify the King’s sub-
jects” was recognized at common law as a “great offence.”
Sir John Knight’s Case, 3 Mod. 117, 118, 87 Eng. Rep. 75,
76  (K.  B.  1686).  Parliament  began  codifying  prohibitions
against such conduct as early as the 1200s and 1300s, most
notably in the Statute of Northampton of 1328.  Bruen, 597
U. S., at 40.  In the aftermath of the Reformation and the
English Civil War, Parliament passed further restrictions.
The Militia Act of 1662, for example, authorized the King’s
agents  to  “seize  all  Armes  in  the  custody  or  possession  of
any person . . . judge[d] dangerous to the Peace of the King-
dome.”  14 Car. 2 c. 3, §13 (1662); J. Greenlee, The Histori-
cal  Justification  for  Prohibiting  Dangerous  Persons  From
Possessing Arms, 20 Wyo. L. Rev. 249, 259 (2020).

The  Glorious  Revolution  cut  back  on  the  power  of  the
Crown to disarm its subjects unilaterally.  King James II
had “caus[ed] several good Subjects being Protestants to be
disarmed at the same Time when Papists were . . . armed.”
1 Wm. & Mary c. 2, §6, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 440 (1689).
By way of rebuke, Parliament adopted the English Bill of
Rights,  which  guaranteed  “that  the  Subjects  which  are
Protestants,  may  have  Arms  for  their  Defence  suitable  to
their Conditions, and as allowed by Law.”  §7, id., at 441.
But as the document itself memorialized, the principle that
arms-bearing was constrained “by Law” remained.  Ibid.

Through these centuries, English law had disarmed not
only brigands and highwaymen but also political opponents

Opinion of the Court

and disfavored religious groups.  By the time of the found-
ing,  however,  state  constitutions  and  the  Second  Amend-
ment had largely eliminated governmental authority to dis-
arm  political  opponents  on  this  side  of  the  Atlantic.    See
Heller, 554 U. S., at 594–595, 600–603.  But regulations tar-
geting  individuals  who  physically  threatened  others  per-
sisted.  Such conduct was often addressed through ordinary
criminal  laws  and  civil  actions,  such  as  prohibitions  on
fighting or private suits against individuals who threatened
others.  See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of
England 145–146, 149–150 (10th ed. 1787) (Blackstone); 3
id.,  at  120.    By  the  1700s  and  early  1800s,  however,  two
distinct  legal  regimes  had  developed  that  specifically  ad-
dressed firearms violence.

The first were the surety laws.  A form of “preventive jus-
tice,” these laws derived from the ancient practice of frank-
pledges.  4 id., at 251–253.  Reputedly dating to the time of
Canute, the frankpledge system involved compelling adult
men  to  organize  themselves  into  ten-man  “tithing[s].”    A.
Lefroy, Anglo-Saxon Period of English Law, Part II, 26 Yale
L. J.  388,  391  (1917).  The  members  of  each  tithing  then
“mutually  pledge[d]  for  each  other’s  good  behaviour.”    4
Blackstone 252.  Should any of the ten break the law, the
remaining nine would be responsible for producing him in
court,  or  else  face  punishment  in his  stead.    D.  Levinson,
Collective Sanctions, 56 Stan. L. Rev. 345, 358 (2003).

Eventually,  the  communal  frankpledge  system  evolved
into  the  individualized  surety  regime.    Under  the  surety
laws, a magistrate could “oblig[e] those persons, [of] whom
there is a probable ground to suspect of future misbehav-
iour,  to  stipulate  with  and  to  give  full  assurance  . . .  that
such  offence  . . .  shall  not  happen[,]  by  finding  pledges  or
securities.”  4 Blackstone 251.  In other words, the law au-
thorized magistrates to require individuals suspected of fu-
ture  misbehavior  to  post  a  bond.  Ibid.   If  an  individual
failed to post a bond,  he would be jailed.  See,  e.g., Mass.

Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)

11

Opinion of the Court

Rev. Stat., ch. 134, §6 (1836).  If the individual did post a
bond and then broke the peace, the bond would be forfeit.  4
Blackstone 253.

Well  entrenched  in  the  common  law,  the  surety  laws
could be invoked to prevent all forms of violence, including
spousal  abuse.    As  Blackstone  explained,  “[w]ives  [could]
demand [sureties] against their husbands; or husbands, if
necessary,  against  their  wives.”  Id.,  at  254.  These  often
took the form of a surety of the peace, meaning that the de-
fendant pledged to “keep the peace.”  Id., at 252–253; see R.
Bloch,  The  American  Revolution,  Wife  Beating,  and  the
Emergent Value of Privacy, 5 Early American Studies 223,
232–233, 234–235 (2007) (Bloch) (discussing peace bonds).
Wives also demanded sureties for good behavior, whereby a
husband pledged to “demean and behave himself well.”  4
Blackstone 253; see Bloch 232–233, 234–235, and n. 34.

While  communities  sometimes  resorted  to  public  sham-
ing  or  vigilante  justice  to  chastise  abusers,  sureties  pro-
vided  the  public  with  a  more  measured  solution.  B.
McConville, The Rise of Rough Music, in Riot and Revelry
in Early America 90–100 (W. Pencak, M. Dennis, & S. New-
man eds. 2002).  In one widely reported incident, Susannah
Wyllys  Strong,  the  wife  of  a  Connecticut  judge,  appeared
before Tapping Reeve in 1790 to make a complaint against
her husband.  K. Ryan, “The Spirit of Contradiction”: Wife
Abuse  in  New  England,  1780–1820,  13  Early  American
Studies 586, 602 (2015).  Newspapers carried the story in
Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York.  Ibid.  Reeve
ultimately ordered the man to post a bond of £1,000.  Id., at
603.

Importantly  for  this  case,  the  surety  laws  also  targeted
the  misuse  of  firearms.  In  1795,  for  example,  Massachu-
setts enacted a law authorizing justices of the peace to “ar-
rest” all who “go armed offensively [and] require of the of-
fender  to  find  sureties  for  his  keeping  the  peace.”    1795
Mass.  Acts  ch.  2,  in  Acts  and  Resolves  of  Massachusetts,

12

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

Opinion of the Court

1794–1795, ch. 26, pp. 66–67 (1896).  Later, Massachusetts
amended its surety laws to be even more specific, authoriz-
ing  the  imposition  of  bonds  from  individuals  “[who  went]
armed with a dirk, dagger, sword, pistol, or other offensive
and dangerous weapon.”  Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 134, §16; see
ibid.  (marginal  note)  (referencing  the  earlier  statute).    At
least nine other jurisdictions did the same.  See Bruen, 597
U. S., at 56, and n. 23.

These  laws  often  offered  the  accused  significant  proce-
dural protections.  Before the accused could be compelled to
post a bond for “go[ing] armed,” a complaint had to be made
to a judge or justice of the peace by “any person having rea-
sonable cause to fear” that the accused would do him harm
or breach the peace.  Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 134, §§1, 16.  The
magistrate  would  take  evidence,  and—if  he  determined
that  cause  existed  for  the  charge—summon  the  accused,
who could respond to the allegations.  §§3–4.  Bonds could
not be required for more than six months at a time, and an
individual could obtain an exception if he needed his arms
for self-defense or some other legitimate reason.  §16.

While the surety laws provided a mechanism for prevent-
ing violence before it occurred, a second regime provided a
mechanism  for  punishing  those  who  had  menaced  others
with firearms.  These were the “going armed” laws, a par-
ticular subset of the ancient common-law prohibition on af-
frays.

Derived from the French word “affraier,” meaning “to ter-
rify,” 4 Blackstone 145, the affray laws traced their origin
to the Statute of Northampton, 2 Edw. 3 c. 3 (1328).  Alt-
hough  the  prototypical  affray  involved  fighting  in  public,
commentators understood affrays to encompass the offense
of “arm[ing]” oneself “to the Terror of the People,” T. Bar-
low, The Justice of the Peace: A Treatise 11 (1745).  Moreo-
ver, the prohibitions—on fighting and going armed—were
often codified in the same statutes.  E.g., 2 Edw. 3 c. 3; Acts
and Laws of His Majesty’s Province of New-Hampshire in

Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)

13

Opinion of the Court

New-England 2 (1761).

Whether classified as an affray law or a distinct prohibi-
tion,  the  going  armed  laws  prohibited  “riding  or  going
armed,  with  dangerous  or  unusual  weapons,  [to]  terrify[ ]
the good people of the land.”  4 Blackstone 149 (emphasis
deleted).  Such  conduct  disrupted  the  “public  order”  and
“le[d]  almost  necessarily  to  actual  violence.”    State  v.
Huntly, 25 N. C. 418, 421–422 (1843) (per curiam).  There-
fore,  the  law  punished  these  acts  with  “forfeiture  of  the
arms . . . and imprisonment.”  4 Blackstone 149.

In  some  instances,  prohibitions  on  going  armed  and  af-
frays  were  incorporated  into  American  jurisprudence
through  the  common  law.    See,  e.g.,  Huntly,  25  N. C.,  at
421–422; O’Neill v. State, 16 Ala. 65, 67 (1849); Hickman v.
State, 193 Md. App. 238, 253–255, 996 A. 2d 974, 983 (2010)
(recognizing  that  common-law  prohibition  on  fighting  in
public remains even now chargeable in Maryland).  More-
over, at least four States—Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
North  Carolina,  and  Virginia—expressly  codified  prohibi-
tions on going armed.  1786 Va. Acts ch. 21; 2 Laws of the
Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  from  Nov.  28,  1780  to
Feb.  28,  1807,  pp.  652–653  (1807);  Acts  and  Laws  of  His
Majesty’s  Province  of  New-Hampshire  in  New-England  2
(1761); Collection of All of the Public Acts of Assembly, of
the Province of North-Carolina: Now in Force and Use 131
(1751) (1741 statute).

Taken together, the surety and going armed laws confirm
what common sense suggests: When an individual poses a
clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening
individual  may  be  disarmed.    Section  922(g)(8)  is  by  no
means identical to these founding era regimes, but it does
not need to be.  See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30.  Its prohibition
on the possession of firearms by those found by a court to
present  a  threat  to  others  fits  neatly  within  the  tradition

14

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

Opinion of the Court

the surety and going armed laws represent.
Like  the  surety  and  going  armed

laws,  Section
922(g)(8)(C)(i) applies to individuals found to threaten the
physical  safety  of  another.  This  provision  is  “relevantly
similar” to those founding era regimes in both why and how
it burdens the Second Amendment right.  Id., at 29.  Section
922(g)(8)  restricts  gun  use  to  mitigate  demonstrated
threats  of  physical  violence,  just  as  the  surety  and  going
armed  laws  do.  Unlike  the  regulation  struck  down  in
Bruen, Section 922(g)(8) does not broadly restrict arms use
by the public generally.

The burden Section 922(g)(8) imposes on the right to bear
arms also fits within our regulatory tradition.  While we do
not suggest that the Second Amendment prohibits the en-
actment of laws banning the possession of guns by catego-
ries of persons thought by a legislature to present a special
danger of misuse, see Heller, 554 U. S., at 626, we note that
Section 922(g)(8) applies only once a court has found that
the defendant “represents a credible threat to the physical
safety”  of  another.  §922(g)(8)(C)(i).  That  matches  the
surety and going armed laws, which involved judicial deter-
minations  of  whether  a  particular  defendant  likely  would
threaten or had threatened another with a weapon.

Moreover, like surety bonds of limited duration, Section
922(g)(8)’s restriction was temporary as applied to Rahimi.
Section 922(g)(8) only prohibits firearm possession so long
as  the  defendant  “is”  subject  to  a  restraining  order.
§922(g)(8).  In Rahimi’s case that is one to two years after
his release from prison, according to Tex. Fam. Code Ann.
§85.025(c) (West 2019).  App. 6–7.

Finally, the penalty—another relevant aspect of the bur-
den—also  fits  within  the  regulatory  tradition.    The  going
armed laws provided for imprisonment, 4 Blackstone 149,
and if imprisonment was permissible to respond to the use
of guns to threaten the physical safety of others, then the
lesser  restriction  of  temporary  disarmament  that  Section

Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)

15

Opinion of the Court

922(g)(8) imposes is also permissible.
  Rahimi argues Heller requires us to affirm, because Sec-
tion 922(g)(8) bars individuals subject to restraining orders
from possessing guns in the home, and in Heller we invali-
dated  an  “absolute  prohibition  of  handguns  . . .  in  the
home.”  554 U. S., at 636; Brief for Respondent 32.  But Hel-
ler never established a categorical rule that the Constitu-
tion prohibits regulations that forbid firearm possession in
the home.  In fact, our opinion stated that many such pro-
hibitions, like those on the possession of firearms by “felons
and the mentally ill,” are “presumptively lawful.”  554 U. S.,
at 626, 627, n. 26.

Our  analysis  of  the  surety  laws  in  Bruen  also  does  not
help Rahimi.  In Bruen, we explained that the surety laws
were not a proper historical analogue for New York’s gun
licensing regime.  597 U. S., at 55–60.  What distinguished
the  regimes,  we  observed,  was  that  the  surety  laws  “pre-
sumed that individuals had a right to . . . carry,” whereas
New  York’s  law  effectively  presumed  that  no  citizen  had
such  a  right,  absent  a  special  need.  Id.,  at  56  (emphasis
deleted).  Section  922(g)(8)(C)(i)  does  not  make  the  same
faulty presumption.  To the contrary, it presumes, like the
surety  laws  before  it,  that  the  Second  Amendment  right
may only be burdened once a defendant has been found to
pose a credible threat to the physical safety of others.  See
ibid.

While we also noted that the surety laws applied different
penalties than New York’s special-need regime, we did so
only to emphasize just how severely the State treated the
rights of its citizens.  Id., at 57.  But as we have explained,
our  Nation’s  tradition  of  firearm  regulation  distinguishes
citizens  who  have  been  found  to  pose  a  credible  threat  to
the physical safety of others from those who have not.  The
conclusion that focused regulations like the surety laws are
not a historical analogue for a broad prohibitory regime like

16

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

Opinion of the Court

New York’s does not mean that they cannot be an appropri-
ate analogue for a narrow one.

4
In  short,  we  have  no  trouble  concluding  that  Section
922(g)(8) survives Rahimi’s facial challenge.  Our tradition
of firearm regulation allows the Government to disarm in-
dividuals  who  present  a  credible  threat  to  the  physical
safety of others.  Section 922(g)(8) can be applied lawfully
to Rahimi.

The dissent reaches a contrary conclusion, primarily on
the  ground  that  the  historical  analogues  for  Section
922(g)(8) are not sufficiently similar to place that provision
in  our  historical  tradition.  The  dissent  does,  however,
acknowledge that Section 922(g)(8) is within that tradition
when it comes to the “why” of the appropriate inquiry.  The
objection  is  to  the  “how.”    See  post,  at  18  (opinion  of
THOMAS, J.).  For the reasons we have set forth, however,
we conclude that Section 922(g)(8) satisfies that part of the
inquiry  as  well.  See  supra,  at  7,  13–15.  As  we  said  in
Bruen, a “historical twin” is not required.  597 U. S., at 30.
For its part, the Fifth Circuit made two errors.  First, like
the dissent, it read Bruen to require a “historical twin” ra-
ther than a “historical analogue.”  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).
Second, it did not correctly apply our precedents governing
facial  challenges.  61  F. 4th,  at  453.    As  we  have  said  in
other  contexts,  “[w]hen  legislation  and  the  Constitution
brush up against each other, [a court’s] task is to seek har-
mony, not to manufacture conflict.”  United States v. Han-
sen,  599  U. S.  762,  781  (2023).    Rather  than  consider  the
circumstances in which Section 922(g)(8) was most likely to
be constitutional, the panel instead focused on hypothetical
scenarios  where  Section  922(g)(8)  might  raise  constitu-
tional concerns.  See 61 F. 4th, at 459; id., at 465–467 (Ho,
J.,  concurring).    That  error  left  the  panel  slaying  a  straw

Finally, in holding that Section 922(g)(8) is constitutional
as  applied  to  Rahimi,  we  reject  the  Government’s  conten-
tion that Rahimi may be disarmed simply because he is not
“responsible.”  Brief for United States 6; see Tr. of Oral Arg.
8–11.  “Responsible”  is  a  vague  term.    It  is  unclear  what
such a rule would entail.  Nor does such a line derive from
our case law.  In Heller and Bruen, we used the term “re-
sponsible” to describe the class of ordinary citizens who un-
doubtedly  enjoy  the  Second  Amendment  right.  See,  e.g.,
Heller, 554 U. S., at 635; Bruen, 597 U. S., at 70.  But those
decisions did not define the term and said nothing about the
status of citizens who were not “responsible.”  The question
was simply not presented.

*
In Heller, McDonald, and Bruen, this Court did not “un-
dertake  an  exhaustive  historical  analysis  . . .  of  the  full
scope of the Second Amendment.”  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 31.
Nor do we do so today.  Rather, we conclude only this: An
individual found by a court to pose a credible threat to the
physical  safety  of  another  may  be  temporarily  disarmed
consistent with the Second Amendment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit

——————

2 Many of the potential faults that the Fifth Circuit identifies in Section
922(g)(8) appear to sound in due process rather than the Second Amend-
ment.  E.g., 61 F. 4th, at 459; id., at 465–467 (Ho, J., concurring).  As we
have explained, unless these hypothetical faults occur in every case, they
do not justify invalidating Section 922(g)(8) on its face.  See United States
v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987) (a facial challenge fails if the law is
constitutional in at least some of its applications).  In any event, we need
not address any due process concern here because this challenge was not
litigated as a due process challenge and there is no such claim before us.
See this Court’s Rule 14.1(a).

UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[June 21, 2024]

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with  whom  JUSTICE KAGAN  joins,

concurring.

Today, the Court applies its decision in New York State
Rifle  &  Pistol  Assn.,  Inc.  v.  Bruen,  597  U. S.  1  (2022),  for
the  first  time.    Although  I  continue  to  believe  that  Bruen
was wrongly decided, see id., at 83–133 (Breyer, J., joined
by  SOTOMAYOR  and  KAGAN,  JJ.,  dissenting),  I  join  the
Court’s  opinion  applying  that  precedent  to  uphold  18
U. S. C. §922(g)(8).

The Court today emphasizes that a challenged regulation
“must  comport  with  the  principles  underlying  the  Second
Amendment,” but need not have a precise historical match.
Ante, at 7–8.  I agree.  I write separately to highlight why
the Court’s interpretation of Bruen, and not the dissent’s, is
the right one.  In short, the Court’s interpretation permits
a  historical  inquiry  calibrated  to  reveal  something  useful
and transferable to the present day, while the dissent would
make the historical inquiry so exacting as to be useless, a
too-sensitive alarm that sounds whenever a regulation did
not exist in an essentially identical form at the founding.

I
  Even under Bruen, this is an easy case.  Section 922(g)(8)
prohibits  an  individual  subject  to  a  domestic  violence  re-
straining order from possessing a firearm, so long as certain
criteria  are  met.  See  ante,  at  3–4.    Section  922(g)(8)  is

2

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

wholly consistent with the Nation’s history and tradition of
firearm regulation.

The Court correctly concludes that “the Second Amend-
ment  permits  the  disarmament  of  individuals  who  pose  a
credible threat to the physical safety of others.”  Ante, at 8.
That conclusion finds historical support in both the surety
laws, which “provided a mechanism for preventing violence
before it occurred” by requiring an individual who posed a
credible threat of violence to another to post a surety, and
the “going armed” laws, which “provided a mechanism for
punishing  those  who  had  menaced  others  with  firearms”
through  forfeiture  of  the  arms  or imprisonment.  Ante,  at
12.  “Taken together, the surety and going armed laws con-
firm  what  common  sense  suggests:  When  an  individual
poses  a  clear  threat  of  physical  violence  to  another,  the
threatening individual may be disarmed.”  Ante, at 13.  Sec-
tion 922(g)(8)’s prohibition on gun possession for individu-
als subject to domestic violence restraining orders is part of
that “tradition of firearm regulation allow[ing] the Govern-
ment to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to
the physical safety of others,” ante, at 16, as are the similar
restrictions that have been adopted by 48 States and Terri-
tories, see Brief for United States 34–35, and nn. 22–23 (col-
lecting statutes).

The Court’s opinion also clarifies an important methodo-
logical  point  that  bears  repeating:  Rather  than  asking
whether a present-day gun regulation has a precise histor-
ical  analogue,  courts  applying  Bruen  should  “conside[r]
whether  the  challenged  regulation  is  consistent  with  the
principles that underpin our regulatory tradition.”  Ante, at
7  (emphasis  added);  see  also  ante,  at  7–8  (“The  law  must
comport with the principles underlying the Second Amend-
ment, but it need not be a ‘dead ringer’ or a ‘historical twin’ ”
(quoting  Bruen,  597  U. S.,  at  30)).    Here,  for  example,
the  Government  has  not  identified  a  founding-era  or
Reconstruction-era law that specifically disarmed domestic

abusers, see, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 40 (conceding as much),
but it did not need to do so.  Although §922(g)(8) “is by no
means identical” to the surety or going armed laws, ante, at
13, it “restricts gun use to mitigate demonstrated threats of
physical violence, just as the surety and going armed laws
d[id],” ante, at 14.  That shared principle is sufficient.

II
The  dissent  reaches  a  different  conclusion  by  applying
the  strictest  possible  interpretation  of  Bruen.  It  picks  off
the  Government’s  historical  sources  one  by  one,  viewing
any basis for distinction as fatal.  See, e.g., post, at 18 (opin-
ion of THOMAS, J.) (“Although surety laws shared a common
justification with §922(g)(8), surety laws imposed a materi-
ally  different  burden”);  post,  at  25–26  (explaining  that
“[a]ffray laws are wide of the mark” because they “expressly
carve out the very conduct §922(g)(8) was designed to pre-
vent  (interpersonal  violence  in  the  home)”).    The  dissent
urges a close look “at the historical law’s justification as ar-
ticulated during the relevant time period,” post, at 28, and
a  “careful  parsing  of  regulatory  burdens”  to  ensure  that
courts do not “stray too far from [history] by eliding mate-
rial differences between historical and modern laws,” post,
at 15.  The dissent criticizes this Court for adopting a more
“piecemeal approach” that distills principles from a variety
of historical evidence rather than insisting on a precise his-
torical analogue.  Post, at 21.

If the dissent’s interpretation of Bruen were the law, then
Bruen really would be the “one-way ratchet” that I and the
other dissenters in that case feared, “disqualify[ing] virtu-
ally any ‘representative historical analogue’ and mak[ing]
it  nearly  impossible  to  sustain  common-sense  regulations
necessary to our Nation’s safety and security.”  597 U. S., at
112 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Thankfully, the Court rejects
that rigid approach to the historical inquiry.  As the Court
puts  it  today,  Bruen  was  “not  meant  to  suggest  a  law

4

trapped in amber.”  Ante, at 7.

This case lays bare the perils of the dissent’s approach.
Because the dissent concludes that “§922(g)(8) addresses a
societal problem—the risk of interpersonal violence—‘that
has  persisted  since  the  18th  century,’ ”  it  insists  that  the
means  of  addressing  that  problem  cannot  be  “ ‘materially
different’ ” from the means that existed in the 18th century.
Post, at 7.  That is so, it seems, even when the weapons in
question  have  evolved  dramatically.    See  R.  Roth,  Why
Guns  Are  and  Are  Not  the  Problem,  in  A  Right  To  Bear
Arms?: The Contested Role of History in Contemporary De-
bates on the Second Amendment 117 (J. Tucker, B. Hacker,
&  M.  Vining  eds.  2019)  (explaining  that  guns  in  the  18th
century  took  a  long  time  to  load,  typically  fired  only  one
shot, and often misfired).  According to the dissent, the so-
lution cannot be “materially different” even when societal
perception of the problem has changed, and even if it is now
clear  to  everyone  that  the  historical  means  of  addressing
the  problem  had  been  wholly  inadequate.  Given  the  fact
that the law at the founding was more likely to protect hus-
bands who abused their spouses than offer some measure
of  accountability,  see,  e.g.,  R.  Siegel,  “The  Rule  of  Love”:
Wife  Beating  as  Prerogative  and  Privacy,  105  Yale  L. J.
2117, 2154–2170 (1996), it is no surprise that that genera-
tion  did  not  have  an  equivalent  to  §922(g)(8).  Under  the
dissent’s approach, the legislatures of today would be lim-
ited not by a distant generation’s determination that such
a  law  was  unconstitutional,  but  by  a  distant  generation’s
failure to consider that such a law might be necessary.  His-
tory has a role to play in Second Amendment analysis, but
a rigid adherence to history, (particularly history predating
the inclusion of women and people of color as full members
of  the  polity),  impoverishes  constitutional  interpretation
and hamstrings our democracy.

III
The Court today clarifies Bruen’s historical inquiry and
rejects the dissent’s exacting historical test.  I welcome that
development.  That being said, I remain troubled by Bruen’s
myopic  focus  on  history  and  tradition,  which  fails  to  give
full consideration to the real and present stakes of the prob-
lems  facing  our  society  today.    In  my  view,  the  Second
Amendment allows legislators “to take account of the seri-
ous problems posed by gun violence,” Bruen, 597 U. S., at
91 (Breyer, J., dissenting), not merely by asking what their
predecessors at the time of the founding or Reconstruction
thought, but by listening to their constituents and crafting
new  and  appropriately  tailored  solutions.  Under  the
means-end scrutiny  that this Court rejected in  Bruen but
“regularly use[s] . . . in cases involving other constitutional
provisions,” id., at 106, the constitutionality of §922(g)(8) is
even more readily apparent.*

To  start,  the  Government  has  a  compelling  interest  in
keeping firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers.  A
woman who lives in a house with a domestic abuser is five
times more likely to be murdered if the abuser has access
to a gun.  See A. Kivisto & M. Porter, Firearm Use Increases
Risk of Multiple Victims in Domestic Homicides, 48 J. Am.
Acad. Psychiatry & L. 26 (2020).  With over 70 people shot
and killed by an intimate partner each month in the United
States, the seriousness of the problem can hardly be over-
stated.  See  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,

——————

*By “means-end scrutiny,” I refer to the mode of analysis that would
permit courts “to consider the State’s interest in preventing gun violence,
the effectiveness of the contested law in achieving that interest, the de-
gree to which the law burdens the Second Amendment right, and, if ap-
propriate,  any  less  restrictive  alternatives.”  Bruen,  597  U. S.,  at  131
(Breyer, J., dissenting).  Prior to Bruen, the Courts of Appeals would ap-
ply a level of means-end scrutiny “ ‘proportionate to the severity of the
burden that the law imposes on the right’: strict scrutiny if the burden is
severe, and intermediate scrutiny if it is not.”  Id., at 103.

WISQARS  Nat.  Violent  Death  Reporting  System,  Violent
Deaths  Report  2020,  https://wisqars.cdc.gov/nvdrs  (show-
ing that 863 people were killed with a firearm by a spouse
or other intimate partner in 2020).  Because domestic vio-
lence is rarely confined to the intimate partner that receives
the  protective  order,  the  Government’s  interest  extends
even further.  In roughly a quarter of cases where an abuser
killed an intimate partner, the abuser also killed someone
else, such as a child, family member, or roommate.  See S.
Smith, K. Fowler, & P. Niolon, Intimate Partner Homicide
and Corollary Victims in 16 States: National Violent Death
Reporting System, 2003–2009, 104 Am. J. Pub. Health 461,
463–464 (2014).  Moreover, one study found that domestic
disputes were the most dangerous type of call for respond-
ing officers, causing more officer deaths with a firearm than
any  other  type  of  call.  See  N.  Breul  &  M.  Keith,  Deadly
Calls and Fatal Encounters: Analysis of U. S. Law Enforce-
ment Line of Duty Deaths When Officers Responded to Dis-
patched  Calls  for  Service  and  Conducted  Enforcement,
2010–2014, p. 15 (2016).

While  the  Second  Amendment  does  not  yield  automati-
cally to the Government’s compelling interest, §922(g)(8) is
tailored  to  the  vital  objective  of  keeping  guns  out  of  the
hands of domestic abusers.  See ante, at 3–4, 14.  Section
922(g)(8)  should  easily  pass  constitutional  muster  under
any level of scrutiny.

Although  I  continue  to  think  that  the  means-end  ap-
proach to Second Amendment analysis is the right one, nei-
ther party asks the Court to reconsider Bruen at this time,
and that question would of course involve other considera-
tions  than  whether  Bruen  was  rightly  decided.    Whether
considered  under  Bruen  or  under  means-end  scrutiny,
§922(g)(8)  clears  the  constitutional  bar.  I  join  in  full  the
Court’s opinion, which offers a more helpful model than the
dissent for lower courts struggling to apply Bruen.

UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[June 21, 2024]

JUSTICE GORSUCH, concurring.
Mr.  Rahimi  pursues  the  “most  difficult  challenge  to
mount  successfully”:  a  facial  challenge.  United  States  v.
Salerno,  481  U. S.  739,  745  (1987).    He  contends  that  18
U. S. C. §922(g)(8) violates the Second Amendment “in all
its applications.”  Bucklew v. Precythe, 587 U. S. 119, 138
(2019).  To prevail, he must show “no set of circumstances”
exists  in  which  that  law  can  be  applied  without  violating
the Second Amendment.  Salerno, 481 U. S., at 745.  I agree
with  the  Court  that  he  has  failed  to  make  that  showing.
Ante, at 8.

That  is  not  because  the  Constitution  has  little  to  say
about  the  matter.  The  Second  Amendment  protects  the
“right of the people to keep and bear Arms.”  “ ‘[T]ext and
history’ ” dictate the contours of that right.  Ante, at 6 (quot-
ing New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597
U. S. 1, 22 (2022)).  As this Court has recognized, too, the
Amendment’s  text  “ ‘guarantee[s]  the  individual  right  to
possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.’ ”  Id.,
at 32 (quoting District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570,
592  (2008)).  And  where  that  “text  covers  an  individual’s
conduct,” a law regulating that conduct may be upheld only
if it is “consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of
firearms regulation.”  597 U. S., at 17; see ante, at 6.

In  this  case,  no  one  questions  that  the  law  Mr.  Rahimi
challenges addresses individual conduct covered by the text

2

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

GORSUCH, J., concurring

of the Second Amendment.  So, in this facial challenge, the
question becomes whether that law, in at least some of its
applications, is consistent with historic firearm regulations.
To prevail, the government need not show that the current
law is a “ ‘dead ringer’ ” for some historical analogue.  Ante,
at 8 (quoting Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30).  But the government
must establish that, in at least some of its applications, the
challenged law “impose[s] a comparable burden on the right
of armed self-defense” to that imposed by a historically rec-
ognized regulation.  Id., at 29; see ante, at 7.  And it must
show that the burden imposed by the current law “is com-
parably justified.”  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 29; see ante, at 7.

Why do we require those showings?  Through them, we
seek to honor the fact that the Second Amendment “codified
a pre-existing right” belonging to the American people, one
that carries the same “scope” today that it was “understood
to have when the people adopted” it.  Heller, 554 U. S., at
592, 634–635.  When the people ratified the Second Amend-
ment,  they  surely  understood  an  arms-bearing  citizenry
posed some risks.  But just as surely they believed that the
right protected by the Second Amendment was itself vital
to  the  preservation  of  life  and  liberty.    See,  e.g.,  1  Black-
stone’s Commentaries, Editor’s App. 300 (St. George Tucker
ed. 1803) (observing that the Second Amendment may rep-
resent the “palladium of liberty,” for “[t]he right of self de-
fence is the first law of nature,” and “in most governments[,]
it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within
the  narrowest  limits”);  3  J.  Story,  Commentaries  on  the
Constitution of the United States §1890, p. 746 (1833) (“The
right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been
considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic”).
We  have  no  authority  to  question  that  judgment.    As
judges  charged  with  respecting  the  people’s  directions  in
the  Constitution—directions  that  are  “trapped  in  amber,”
see ante, at 7—our only lawful role is to apply them in the
cases that come before us.  Developments in the world may

Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)

GORSUCH, J., concurring

change, facts on the ground may evolve, and new laws may
invite  new  challenges,  but  the  Constitution  the  people
adopted remains our enduring guide.  Bruen, 597 U. S., at
27–28; see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 565 U. S. 400, 404–
405 (2012); Caetano v. Massachusetts, 577 U. S. 411, 411–
412 (2016) (per curiam).  If changes are to be made to the
Constitution’s directions, they must be made by the Ameri-
can people.  Nor is there anything remotely unusual about
any of this.  Routinely, litigants and courts alike must con-
sult history when seeking to discern the meaning and scope
of  a  constitutional  provision.
See  post,  at  6–16
(KAVANAUGH,  J.,  concurring)  (offering  examples).  And
when  doing  so,  litigants  and  courts  “must  exercise  care.”
See post, at 3, n. (BARRETT, J., concurring).

Consider just one example.  We have recognized that the
Sixth  Amendment  enshrines  another  pre-existing  right:
the  right  of  a  defendant  to  confront  his  accusers  at  trial.
Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 54 (2004).  Just as
here, we have recognized that, in placing this right in the
Constitution, the people set its scope, “admitting only those
exceptions established at the time of the founding.”  Ibid.
And,  just  as  here,  when  a  party  asks  us  to  sustain  some
modern  exception  to  the  confrontation  right,  we  require
them to point to a close historic analogue to justify it.  See
Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 358–361 (2008).  Just as
here, too, we have expressly rejected arguments that courts
should proceed differently, such as by trying to glean from
historic  exceptions  overarching  “policies,”  “ ‘purposes,’ ”  or
“values” to guide them in future cases.  See id., at 374–375
(opinion  of  Scalia,  J.).    We  have  rejected  those  paths  be-
cause  the  Constitution  enshrines  the  people’s  choice  to
achieve certain policies, purposes, and values “through very
specific means”:  the right of confrontation as originally un-
derstood  at  the  time  of  the  founding.    Id.,  at  375.    As  we
have put it, a court may not “extrapolate” from the Consti-
tution’s text and history “the values behind [that right], and

4

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

GORSUCH, J., concurring

then . . . enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve
(in the courts’ views) those underlying values.”  Ibid.  Pro-
ceeding that way, we have warned, risks handing judges a
license  to  turn  “the  guarantee  of  confrontation”  into  “no
guarantee at all.”  Ibid.  As there, so too here:  Courts must
proceed  with  care  in  making  comparisons  to  historic  fire-
arms regulations, or else they risk gaming away an individ-
ual right the people expressly preserved for themselves in
the Constitution’s text.

Proceeding with this well in mind today, the Court rightly
holds that Mr. Rahimi’s facial challenge to §922(g)(8) can-
not  succeed.  It  cannot  because,  through  surety  laws  and
restrictions  on  “going  armed,”  the  people  in  this  country
have understood from the start that the government may
disarm an individual temporarily after a “judicial determi-
natio[n]” that he “likely would threaten or ha[s] threatened
another with a weapon.”  Ante, at 14.  And, at least in some
cases, the statute before us works in the same way and does
so for the same reasons:  It permits a court to disarm a per-
son only if, after notice and hearing, it finds that he “repre-
sents  a  credible  threat  to  the  physical  safety”  of  others.
§§922(g)(8)(A), (g)(8)(C)(i).  A court, too, may disarm an in-
dividual only for so long as its order is in effect.  §922(g)(8).
In short, in at least some applications, the challenged law
does  not  diminish  any  aspect  of  the  right  the  Second
Amendment  was  originally  understood  to  protect.  See
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 24.

I appreciate that one of our colleagues sees things differ-
ently.  Post, at 6–7 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).  But if reason-
able minds can disagree whether §922(g)(8) is analogous to
past practices originally understood to fall outside the Sec-
ond Amendment’s scope, we at least agree that is the only
proper  question  a  court  may  ask.  Post,  at  5.  Discerning
what the original meaning of the Constitution requires in
this or that case may sometimes be difficult.  Asking that
question,  however,  at  least  keeps  judges  in  their  proper

Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)

GORSUCH, J., concurring

lane, seeking to honor the supreme law the people have or-
dained  rather  than  substituting  our  will  for  theirs.  And
whatever indeterminacy may be associated with seeking to
honor  the  Constitution’s  original  meaning  in  modern  dis-
putes,  that  path  offers  surer  footing  than  any  other  this
Court has attempted from time to time.  Come to this Court
with arguments from text and history, and we are bound to
reason  through  them  as  best  we  can.  (As  we have  today.)
Allow judges to reign unbounded by those materials, or per-
mit  them  to  extrapolate  their  own  broad  new  principles
from those sources, and no one can have any idea how they
might rule.  (Except the judges themselves.)  Faithful ad-
herence to the Constitution’s original meaning may be an
imperfect guide, but I can think of no more perfect one for
us to follow.

Just  consider  how  lower  courts  approached  the  Second
Amendment before our decision in Bruen.  They reviewed
firearm regulations under a two-step test that quickly “de-
volved”  into  an  interest-balancing  inquiry,  where  courts
would weigh a law’s burden on the right against the bene-
fits  the  law  offered.  See Rogers  v.  Grewal,  590  U. S.  ___,
___, and n. 1 (2020) (THOMAS, J., joined by KAVANAUGH, J.,
dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 5, and n. 1);
see also, e.g., Peruta v. County of San Diego, 742 F. 3d 1144,
1167–1168,  1176–1177  (CA9  2014);  Drake  v.  Filko,  724
F. 3d 426, 457 (CA3 2013) (Hardiman, J., dissenting).  Some
judges expressed concern that the prevailing two-step test
had  become  “just  window  dressing  for  judicial  policymak-
ing.”  Duncan v. Bonta, 19 F. 4th 1087, 1148 (CA9 2021) (en
banc)  (Bumatay,  J.,  dissenting).    To  them,  the  inquiry
worked as a “black box regime” that gave a judge broad li-
cense to support policies he “[f]avored” and discard those he
disliked.  Ibid.    How  did  the  government  fare  under  that
regime?  In one circuit, it had an “undefeated, 50–0 record.”
Id., at 1167, n. 8 (VanDyke, J., dissenting).  In Bruen, we
rejected that approach for one guided by constitutional text

6

and history.  597 U. S., at 19.  Perhaps judges’ jobs would
be easier if they could simply strike the policy balance they
prefer.  And a principle that the government always wins
surely would be simple for judges to implement.  But either
approach would let judges stray far from the Constitution’s
promise.  See Heller, 554 U. S., at 634.

One  more  point:    Our  resolution  of  Mr.  Rahimi’s  facial
challenge to §922(g)(8) necessarily leaves open the question
whether the statute might be unconstitutional as applied in
“particular circumstances.”  Salerno, 481 U. S., at 751.  So,
for  example,  we  do  not  decide  today  whether  the  govern-
ment may disarm a person without a judicial finding that
he  poses  a  “credible  threat”  to  another’s  physical  safety.
§922(g)(8)(C)(i); see ante, at 8.  We do not resolve whether
the  government  may  disarm  an  individual  permanently.
See ante, at 14 (stressing that, “like surety bonds of limited
duration,  Section  922(g)(8)’s  restriction  was  temporary  as
applied  to  [Mr.]  Rahimi”).  We  do  not  determine  whether
§922(g)(8) may be constitutionally enforced against a per-
son who uses a firearm in self-defense.  Notably, the surety
laws that inform today’s decision allowed even an individ-
ual found to pose a threat to another to “obtain an exception
if he needed his arms for self-defense.”  Ante, at 12; see also
post, at 23 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).  Nor do we purport to
approve in advance other laws denying firearms on a cate-
gorical basis to any group of persons a legislature happens
to  deem,  as  the  government  puts  it,  “not  ‘responsible.’”
Ante,  at  17  (quoting  Brief  for  United  States  6);  see  Tr.  of
Oral Arg. 31–32; see also post, at 27 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)
(“Not  a  single  Member  of  the  Court  adopts  the  Govern-
ment’s theory”).

We  do  not  resolve  any  of  those  questions  (and  perhaps
others like them) because we cannot.  Article III of the Con-
stitution  vests  in  this  Court  the  power  to  decide  only  the
“ ‘actual  cas[e]’ ”  before  us,  “ ‘not  abstractions.’ ”    Public
Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 89 (1947).  And the case

Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)

7

GORSUCH, J., concurring

before us does not pose the question whether the challenged
statute  is  always  lawfully  applied,  or  whether  other  stat-
utes  might  be  permissible,  but  only  whether  this  one  has
any  lawful  scope.  Nor  should  future  litigants  and  courts
read any more into our decision than that.  As this Court
has long recognized, what we say in our opinions must “be
taken  in  connection  with  the  case  in  which  those  expres-
sions  are  used,”  Cohens  v.  Virginia,  6  Wheat.  264,  399
(1821),  and  may  not  be  “stretch[ed]  . . .  beyond  their  con-
text,” Brown v. Davenport, 596 U. S. 118, 141 (2022).

Among  all  the  opinions  issued  in  this  case,  its  central
messages should not be lost.  The Court reinforces the focus
on text, history, and tradition, following exactly the path we
described in Bruen.  Ante, at 5–8.  And after carefully con-
sulting  those  materials,  the  Court  “conclude[s]  only  this”:
“An individual found by a court to pose a credible threat to
the physical safety of another may be temporarily disarmed
consistent with the Second Amendment.”  Ante, at 17 (em-
phasis  added).  With  these  observations,  I  am  pleased  to
concur.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, concurring.
The Framers of the Constitution and Bill of Rights wisely
sought the best of both worlds: democratic self-government
and the protection of individual rights against excesses of
that  form  of  government.  In  justiciable  cases,  this  Court
determines whether a democratically enacted law or other
rights
infringes  on
government  action
guaranteed  by  the  Constitution.  When  performing  that
Article  III  duty,  the  Court  does  not  implement  its  own
policy  judgments  about,  for  example,  free  speech  or  gun
regulation.    Rather,  the  Court  interprets  and  applies  the
Constitution  by  examining  text,  pre-ratification  and  post-
ratification  history,  and  precedent.  The  Court’s  opinion
today does just that, and I join it in full.

individual

The concurring opinions, and the briefs of the parties and
amici in this case, raise important questions about judicial
reliance  on  text,  history,  and  precedent,  particularly  in
Second Amendment cases.  I add this concurring opinion to
review  the  proper  roles  of  text,  history,  and  precedent  in
constitutional interpretation.

I
The American people established an enduring American
Constitution.  The  first  and  most  important  rule  in
constitutional  interpretation  is  to  heed  the  text—that  is,
the actual words of the Constitution—and to interpret that

2

KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

text  according  to  its  ordinary  meaning  as  originally
understood.  The text of the Constitution is the “Law of the
Land.”  Art.  VI.    As  a  general  matter,  the  text  of  the
Constitution says what it means and means what it says.
And unless and until it is amended, that text controls.

In  many  important  provisions,  the  Constitution  is  a
document  of  majestic  specificity  with  “strikingly  clean
prose.”  A.  Amar,  America’s  Constitution  xi  (2005).    Two
Houses  of  Congress.  A  House  elected  every  two  years.
Senators serve 6-year terms.  Two Senators per State.  A
State’s  equal  suffrage  in  the  Senate  may  not  be  changed
without  the  State’s  consent.    A  two-thirds  House  vote  to

amend  the  Constitution.  Congress  meets  at  noon  on
January 3rd unless otherwise specified by Congress.  The
District  of  Columbia  votes  in  Presidential  elections.    The
list goes on.

Those  and  many  other  constitutional  provisions  are
relatively clear.  And when the “framers of the Constitution
employed words in their natural sense; and where they are
plain and clear, resort to collateral aids to interpretation is
unnecessary and cannot be indulged in to narrow or enlarge
the text.”  McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S. 1, 27 (1892).

Of course, some provisions of the Constitution are broadly
worded  or  vague—to  put  it  in  Madison’s  words,  “more  or

less obscure and equivocal.”  The Federalist No. 37, p. 229
(C.  Rossiter  ed.  1961).  As  Chief  Justice  Rehnquist
explained, the Constitution is in some parts “obviously not
a specifically worded document but one couched in general
phraseology.”  W.  Rehnquist,  The  Notion  of  a  Living
Constitution, 54 Texas L. Rev. 693, 697 (1976).

That is especially true with respect to the broadly worded
or vague individual-rights provisions.  (I will use the terms
“broadly  worded”  and  “vague”  interchangeably  in  this
opinion.)  For example, the First Amendment provides that
“Congress  shall  make  no  law”  “abridging  the  freedom  of
speech.”  And  the  Second  Amendment,  at  issue  here,
guarantees  that “the right of  the  people to keep and bear
Arms” “shall not be infringed.”

Read  literally,  those  Amendments  might  seem  to  grant
absolute  protection,  meaning  that  the  government  could
never regulate speech or guns in any way.  But American
law  has
long  recognized,  as  a  matter  of  original
understanding  and  original  meaning,  that  constitutional
rights generally come with exceptions.

With respect to the First Amendment, for example, this
Court’s  “jurisprudence  over  the  past  216”—now  233—
“years has rejected an absolutist interpretation.”   Federal
Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S.
449,  482  (2007)  (opinion  of  ROBERTS, C. J.);  see  R.  Bork,
Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems,
47 Ind. L. J. 1, 21–22 (1971).  From 1791 to the present, “the
First  Amendment  has  permitted  restrictions  upon  the
content  of  speech  in  a  few  limited  areas”—including
obscenity,  defamation,  fraud,  and  incitement.    United
States  v.  Stevens,  559  U. S.  460,  468  (2010)  (quotation
marks  omitted).    So  too  with  respect  to  the  Second
Amendment:  “Like  most  rights,  the  right  secured  by  the
Second Amendment is not unlimited”; it is “not a right to
keep  and  carry  any  weapon  whatsoever  in  any  manner
whatsoever  and  for  whatever  purpose.”  District  of

A  recurring  and  difficult  issue  for  judges,  therefore,  is
how to interpret vague constitutional text.  That issue often
arises (as here) in the context of determining exceptions to
textually  guaranteed  individual  rights.  To  what  extent
does  the  Constitution  allow  the  government  to  regulate
speech or guns, for example?1

In many cases, judicial precedent informs or controls the
answer (more on that later).  But absent precedent, there
are really only two potential answers to the question of how
to  determine  exceptions  to  broadly  worded  constitutional
rights: history or policy.

Generally speaking, the historical approach examines the
laws, practices, and understandings from before and after
ratification  that  may  help  the  interpreter  discern  the
meaning  of  the  constitutional  text  and  the  principles
embodied  in  that  text.  The  policy  approach  rests  on  the
philosophical or policy dispositions of the individual judge.

History, not policy, is the proper guide.
For more than 200 years, this Court has relied on history
when construing vague constitutional text in all manner of
constitutional  disputes.  For  good  reason.    History  can
supply  evidence  of  the  original  meaning  of  vague  text.
History is far less subjective than policy.  And reliance on
history is more consistent with the properly neutral judicial

——————

1 There  are  two  ways  to  frame  this  point—either  (i)  determining  the
exceptions  to  a  constitutional  right  or  (ii)  determining  the  affirmative
scope or contours of that constitutional right.  Either way, the analysis
is the same—does the constitutional provision, as originally understood,
permit  the  challenged  law?    This  opinion  uses  the  term  “exceptions,”
which  underscores  that  the  constitutional  baseline  is  protection  of  the
textually enumerated right.  See Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin
Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 482 (2007) (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)
(stating  in  a  First  Amendment  case  that  “it  is  worth  recalling  the
language we are applying”).

role than an approach where judges subtly (or not so subtly)
impose their own policy views on the American people.

Judges are like umpires, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE has aptly
explained.  And in a constitutional system that counts on
an independent Judiciary, judges must act like umpires.  To
be an umpire, the judge “must stick close to the text and the
history,  and  their  fair  implications,”  because  there  “is  no
principled way” for a neutral judge “to prefer any claimed
human value to any other.”  R. Bork, Neutral Principles and
Some First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind. L. J. 1, 8 (1971).
History  establishes  a  “criterion  that  is  conceptually  quite
separate  from  the  preferences  of  the  judge  himself.”  A.
Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849,
864  (1989).  When  properly  applied,  history  helps  ensure
that  judges  do  not  simply  create  constitutional  meaning
“out of whole cloth.”  A. Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of
Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1183 (1989).2

Absent  precedent,

therefore,  history  guides

the
interpretation of vague constitutional text.  Of course, this
Court has been deciding constitutional cases for about 230
years,  so  relevant  precedent  often  exists.  As  the  Court’s
opinions over time amply demonstrate, precedent matters
a great deal in constitutional interpretation.

I now turn to explaining how courts apply pre-ratification

——————

2 The historical approach applies when the text is vague.  But the text
of the Constitution always controls.  So history contrary to clear text is
not  to  be  followed.    See,  e.g.,  INS  v.  Chadha,  462  U. S.  919,  945–959
(1983); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 546–547 (1969); Brown v.
Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 490–495, and n. 5 (1954); cf. Sedition
Act of 1798, ch. 74, 1 Stat. 596.  In some cases, there may be debate about
whether  the  relevant  text  is  sufficiently  clear  to  override  contrary
historical practices.  See, e.g., NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U. S. 513, 613
(2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (“What the majority needs to
sustain its judgment is an ambiguous text and a clear historical practice.
What it has is a clear text and an at-best-ambiguous historical practice”).
The  basic  principle  remains:    Text  controls  over  contrary  historical
practices.

history,  post-ratification  history,  and  precedent  when
analyzing vague constitutional text.

A

Pre-ratification  history.  When

interpreting  vague
constitutional  text,  the  Court  typically  scrutinizes  the
stated intentions and understandings of the Framers and
Ratifiers  of  the  Constitution
(or,  as  relevant,  the
Amendments).  The Court also looks to the understandings
of the American people from the pertinent ratification era.
Those  intentions  and  understandings  do  not  necessarily
determine  meaning,  but  they  may  be  strong  evidence  of
meaning.  See  generally,  e.g.,  The  Federalist  (C.  Rossiter
ed.  1961);  Records  of  the  Federal  Convention  of  1787  (M.
Farrand ed. 1911); Debates on the Federal Constitution (J.
Elliot ed. 1836).

Especially  for  the  original  Constitution  and  the  Bill  of
Rights, the Court also examines the pre-ratification history
in  the  American  Colonies,  including  pre-ratification  laws
and practices.  And the Court pays particular attention to
the historical laws and practices in the United States from
Independence  in  1776  until  ratification  in  1788  or  1791.
Pre-ratification  American  history  can  shed  light  on
constitutional meaning in various ways.

For  example,  some  provisions  of  the  Constitution  use
language that appeared in the Articles of Confederation or
state  constitutional  provisions.  And  when  the  language
that  appeared  in  the  Articles  of  Confederation  or  in  state
constitutions is the same as or similar to the language in
the U. S. Constitution, the history of how people understood
the  language  in  the  Articles  or  state  constitutions  can
inform  interpretation  of  that  language  in  the  U. S.
Constitution.  See,  e.g.,  Moore  v.  Harper,  600  U. S.  1,  33
(2023) (the “Framers did not write the Elections Clause on
a blank slate—they instead borrowed from the Articles of
Confederation”  as  evidenced  by  their  use  of  “closely

parallel” language); District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S.
570,  600–601  (2008)  (“Our  interpretation  is  confirmed  by
analogous  arms-bearing  rights  in  state  constitutions  that
preceded and immediately followed adoption of the Second
Amendment”); United States Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax
Comm’n, 434 U. S. 452, 460, and n. 10 (1978) (“The history
of
of
Confederation  suggests  the  same  distinction  between
‘treaties,  alliances,  and  confederations’  on  the  one  hand,
and  ‘agreements  and  compacts’  on  the  other,”  as  the
distinction made in the Constitution’s Treaty and Compact
Clauses).

interstate  agreements  under

the  Articles

Similarly,  other  pre-ratification  national  or  state  laws
and  practices  may  sometimes  help  an  interpreter  discern
the meaning of particular constitutional provisions.  Those
pre-ratification American laws and practices formed part of
the  foundation  on  which  the  Framers  constructed  the
Constitution  and  Bill  of  Rights.    Indeed,  the  Constitution
did  not  displace  but
largely  co-exists  with  state
constitutions  and  state  laws,  except  to  the  extent  they
conflict with federal law.  See Art. VI.

On the other hand, some pre-ratification history can be
probative  of  what  the  Constitution  does  not  mean.  The
Framers  drafted  and  approved  many  provisions  of  the
Constitution precisely to depart from rather than adhere to
certain pre-ratification laws, practices, or understandings.

For example, the “defects” of the Articles of Confederation
inspired some of the key decisions made by the Framers in
Philadelphia and by the First Congress in drafting the Bill
of Rights.  The Federalist No. 37, at 224 (J. Madison); see,
e.g., id., at 226 (“the existing Confederation is founded on
principles which are fallacious; that we must consequently
change this first foundation, and with it the superstructure
resting upon it”); PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New Jersey, 594
U. S.  482,  508  (2021)  (“When  the  Framers  met  in
Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, they sought to create

a cohesive national sovereign in response to the failings of
the  Articles  of  Confederation”);  Sosa  v.  Alvarez-Machain,
542 U. S. 692, 716–717 (2004) (“The Continental Congress
was  hamstrung  by  its  inability  to  ‘cause  infractions  of
treaties, or of the law of nations to be punished,’ ” and the
“Framers  responded  by  vesting  the  Supreme  Court  with
original jurisdiction over ‘all Cases affecting Ambassadors,
other public ministers and Consuls,’ and the First Congress
followed  through”  (citation  omitted));  U. S.  Term  Limits,
Inc.  v.  Thornton,  514  U. S.  779,  803  (1995)  (“After  the

diminished during  their  Continuance  in  Office”);  see, e.g.,

convention could do” “was to avoid the errors suggested by
the  past  experience  of  other  countries,  as  well  as  of  our

Constitution”).

This Court has recognized, for example, that no “purpose
in  ratifying  the  Bill  of  Rights  was  clearer  than  that  of
securing for the people of the United States much greater
freedom of religion, expression, assembly, and petition than
the  people  of  Great  Britain  had  ever  enjoyed.”    Bridges
v. California, 314 U. S. 252, 265 (1941).  Ratified as it was
“while the memory of many oppressive English restrictions
on  the  enumerated  liberties  was  still  fresh,”  the  Bill  of
Rights “cannot reasonably be taken as approving prevalent
English  practices.”
Ibid.;  see,  e.g.,  Hosanna-Tabor
Evangelical  Lutheran  Church  and  School  v.  EEOC,  565
U. S.  171,  183  (2012)  (“Familiar  with  life  under  the
established  Church  of  England,  the  founding  generation
sought  to  foreclose  the  possibility  of  a  national  church”
through  the  First  Amendment’s  Establishment  Clause);
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 60 (1932) (right to counsel
under  the  Sixth  Amendment  reflected  America’s  rejection
of the English common law rule that a “person charged with
treason or felony was denied the aid of counsel”).3

——————

3 To be sure, as the Court’s cases reveal, pre-ratification English law
and practices may supply background for some constitutional provisions.
But the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, did not purport to take
English law or history wholesale and silently download it into the U. S.
Constitution.  See, e.g., Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 975 (1991)
(opinion  of  Scalia,  J.)  (“Unless  one  accepts  the  notion  of  a  blind
incorporation,  however,  the  ultimate  question  is  not  what  ‘cruell  and
unusuall punishments’ meant in the [English] Declaration of Rights, but
what  its  meaning  was  to  the  Americans  who  adopted  the  Eighth
Amendment”).  Therefore, reflexively resorting to English law or history
without careful analysis can sometimes be problematic because America
had fought a war—and would soon fight another in 1812—to free itself
from British law and practices and rid itself of tyrannical British rule.
See  The  Federalist  No.  45,  p.  289  (C.  Rossiter  ed.  1961)  (J.  Madison)
(“Was,  then,  the  American  Revolution  effected,  was  the  American
Confederacy formed, was the precious blood of thousands spilt, and the
hard-earned  substance  of  millions  lavished,  not  that  the  people  of
America  should  enjoy  peace,  liberty,  and  safety,”  but  that  they  should

10

KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

The Equal Protection Clause provides another example.
Ratified in 1868, that Clause sought to reject the Nation’s
history of racial discrimination, not to backdoor incorporate
racially discriminatory and oppressive historical practices
and  laws  into  the  Constitution.    See  generally  Flowers  v.
Mississippi, 588 U. S. 284 (2019); Batson v. Kentucky, 476
U. S.  79  (1986);  Loving  v.  Virginia,  388  U. S.  1  (1967);
Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954).

In short, pre-ratification American history—that is, pre-
laws,  practices,  and  understandings—can
ratification
inform interpretation of vague constitutional provisions in
the  original  Constitution  and  Bill  of  Rights.  The  same
principle  of  looking  to  relevant  pre-ratification  history
applies when interpreting broadly worded language in the
later  amendments,  including  the  Fourteenth  Amendment
ratified  in  1868.  But  in  using  pre-ratification  history,
courts  must  exercise  care  to  rely  only  on  the  history  that
the  Constitution  actually  incorporated  and  not  on  the
history that the Constitution left behind.

text  and  determining  exceptions

Post-ratification history.  As the Framers made clear, and
as this Court has stated time and again for more than two
centuries, post-ratification history—sometimes referred to
as tradition—can also be important for interpreting vague
constitutional
to
individual  constitutional  rights.  When  the  text  is  vague
and  the  pre-ratification  history  is  elusive  or  inconclusive,
post-ratification  history  becomes  especially  important.
Indeed, absent precedent, there can be little else to guide a
judge  deciding  a  constitutional  case  in  that  situation,
unless  the  judge  simply  defaults  to  his  or  her  own  policy
preferences.

interpreting  and  applying

governments  began
the
Constitution’s  text.  They  have  continued  to  do  so  ever
since.  As  the  national  and  state  governments  over  time
have  enacted  laws  and  implemented  practices  to  promote
the  general  welfare,  those  laws  and  practices  have  often
reflected  and  reinforced  common  understandings  of  the
Constitution’s authorizations and limitations.

Post-ratification  interpretations  and  applications  by
government  actors—at  least  when  reasonably  consistent
and  longstanding—can  be  probative  of  the  meaning  of
vague constitutional text.  The collective understanding of
Americans who, over time, have interpreted and applied the
broadly  worded  constitutional  text  can  provide  good
guidance  for  a  judge  who  is  trying  to  interpret  that  same
text decades or centuries later.  See, e.g., Republican Party
of Minn. v.  White, 536  U. S. 765, 785 (2002) (a “universal
long-established  tradition  of  prohibiting  certain
and
conduct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition
is constitutional” (quotation marks omitted)); United States
v. Midwest Oil Co., 236 U. S. 459, 472–473 (1915) (“officers,
law-makers and citizens naturally adjust themselves to any

presumption  that”  unconstitutional  “acts  would  not  have

liquidation, or historical gloss.  Those concepts are probably not identical

interpretation, some important questions can arise, such as: (i) the level
of generality at which to define a historical practice; (ii) how widespread
a  historical  practice  must  have  been; (iii) how  long  ago  it  must  have

Importantly, the Framers themselves intended that post-
ratification  history  would  shed  light  on  the  meaning  of
vague  constitutional  text.    They  understood  that  some
constitutional  text  may  be  “more  or  less  obscure  and
equivocal” such that questions “daily occur in the course of
practice.”  The  Federalist  No.  37,  at  228–229.  Madison
explained  that  the  meaning  of  vague  text  would  be
“liquidated  and  ascertained  by  a  series  of  particular
discussions and adjudications.”  Id., at 229.  In other words,
Madison  articulated  the  Framers’  expectation  and  intent
that  post-ratification  history  would  be  a  proper  and
important tool to help constitutional interpreters determine
the meaning of vague constitutional text.

From  early  on,  this  Court  followed  Madison’s  lead.    In
1819, in one of its most important decisions ever, the Court
addressed  the  scope  of  Article  I’s  Necessary  and  Proper
Clause.  McCulloch  v.  Maryland,  4  Wheat.  316  (1819).
Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall invoked post-
ratification history to conclude that Congress’s authority to
establish a national bank could “scarcely be considered as
an open question.”  Id., at 401.  The constitutionality of the

answer  to  those  various  methodological  questions.  See,  e.g.,  Noel
Canning, 573 U. S., at 522–556; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,

And I will not attempt to answer all of those questions here.  Respected
scholars are continuing to undertake careful analysis.  See generally J.

national  bank  had  “been  recognised  by  many  successive
legislatures,”  and  an  “exposition  of  the  constitution,
deliberately established by legislative acts, on the faith of
which an immense property has been advanced, ought not
to  be  lightly  disregarded.”    Ibid.   Marshall  added:  The
“respective  powers  of  those  who  are  equally  the
representatives of the people, are to be adjusted; if not put
at rest by the practice of the government, ought to receive a
considerable impression from that practice.”  Ibid.

In relying on post-ratification history as a proper tool to
discern  constitutional  meaning,  Madison  and  Marshall
make for a formidable duo.  Moving from distant American
history  to  more  recent  times,  one  can  add  Justice  Scalia.
Throughout his consequential 30-year tenure on this Court,
Justice  Scalia  repeatedly  emphasized  that  constitutional
interpretation  must  take  account  of  text,  pre-ratification
history, and post-ratification history—the last of which he
often referred to as “tradition.”  In his words, when judges
interpret vague or broadly worded constitutional text, the
“traditions  of  our  people”  are  “paramount.”    McDonald  v.
Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 792 (2010) (Scalia, J., concurring).
Constitutional interpretation should reflect “the principles
adhered to, over time, by the American people, rather than
those  favored  by  the  personal  (and  necessarily  shifting)
philosophical  dispositions  of  a  majority  of  this  Court.”
Rutan  v.  Republican  Party  of  Ill.,  497  U. S.  62,  96  (1990)

Justice  Scalia  wrote  for  the  Court  that  “a  critical  tool  of
constitutional  interpretation”  is  “the  examination  of  a
variety  of  legal  and  other  sources  to  determine  the  public
understanding  of  a  legal  text  in  the  period  after  its
enactment or ratification.”  554 U. S., at 605 (emphasis in
original); see also ibid. (“We now address how the Second
Amendment  was  interpreted  from  immediately  after  its
ratification through the end of the 19th century”).

Heller  echoed  years  of  earlier  Scalia  opinions.    To  take
one:  “Where the meaning of a constitutional text (such as
‘the freedom of speech’) is unclear, the widespread and long-
accepted  practices  of  the  American  people  are  the  best
indication  of  what  fundamental  beliefs  it  was intended  to
enshrine.”  McIntyre  v.  Ohio  Elections  Comm’n,  514  U. S.

To the contrary, such traditions are themselves the stuff out
of which the Court’s principles are to be formed.  They are,

As leading actors and theorists in the earliest and latest
chapters  of  the  American  constitutional  story,  Madison,
Marshall, and Scalia made clear that courts should look to
post-ratification  history  as  well  as  pre-ratification  history
to interpret vague constitutional text.

For  more  than  two  centuries—from  the  early  1800s  to
this  case—this  Court  has  done  just  that.  The  Court  has
repeatedly employed post-ratification history to determine
the meaning of vague constitutional text.  Reliance on post-

6 The  Court  has  similarly  relied  on  history  when  deciding  cases
involving textually unenumerated rights under the Due Process Clause
or the Privileges or Immunities Clause.  In those contexts, the baseline
is 180-degrees different:  The text supplies no express protection of any
asserted substantive right.  The Court has recognized exceptions to that
textual  baseline,  but  in  doing  so  has  regularly  observed  that  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  “specially  protects  those  fundamental  rights
and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history
and tradition.”  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720–721 (1997)

C
  Precedent.  With  a  Constitution  and  a  Supreme  Court
that are both more than two centuries old, this Court and
other  courts  are  rarely  interpreting  a  constitutional
provision for the first time.  Rather, a substantial body of
for  many
Supreme  Court  precedent  already  exists
provisions of the Constitution.

Precedent  is  fundamental  to  day-to-day  constitutional
decisionmaking  in  this  Court  and  every  American  court.
The “judicial Power” established in Article III incorporates
the principle of stare decisis, both vertical and horizontal.
As Hamilton stated, to “avoid an arbitrary discretion in the
courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down
by strict rules and precedents” that will “unavoidably swell
to a very considerable bulk” and “serve to define and point
out  their  duty  in  every  particular  case  that  comes  before
them.”  The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (A. Hamilton).

Courts  must  respect  precedent,  while  at  the  same  time
recognizing that precedent on occasion may appropriately
be overturned.  See, e.g., Brown, 347 U. S. 483; West Coast
Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937); see also Ramos
v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. 83, 115–132 (2020) (KAVANAUGH, J.,
concurring  in  part).    In  light  of  the  significant  amount  of
Supreme Court precedent that has built up over time, this
Court and other courts often decide constitutional cases by
reference to those extensive bodies of precedent.

Even then, however, text and history still matter a great
deal.  When determining how broadly or narrowly to read a
precedent;  when  determining  whether  to  extend,  limit,  or
narrow a precedent; or in relatively infrequent cases, when
determining whether to overrule a precedent, a court often
will  consider  how  the  precedent  squares  with  the
Constitution’s text and history.  Therefore, the text, as well
as  pre-ratification  and  post-ratification  history,  may
appropriately function as a gravitational pull on the Court’s
interpretation  of  precedent.    See  Free  Enterprise  Fund

III
Some  say  that  courts  should  determine  exceptions  to
broadly  worded  individual  rights,  including  the  Second
Amendment,  by  looking  to  policy.    Uphold  a  law  if  it  is  a
good idea; strike it down if it is not.  True, the proponents
of  a  policy-based  approach  to  interpretation  of  broadly
worded  or  vague  constitutional  text  usually  do  not  say  so
explicitly  (although  some  do).  Rather,  they  support  a
balancing  approach  variously  known  as  means-end
scrutiny,  heightened  scrutiny,  tiers  of  scrutiny,  rational
basis  with  bite,  or  strict  or  intermediate  or  intermediate-
plus or rigorous or skeptical scrutiny.  Whatever the label
of  the  day,  that  balancing  approach  is  policy  by  another
name.  It requires judges to weigh the benefits against the
burdens of a law and to uphold the law as constitutional if,
in  the  judge’s  view,  the  law  is  sufficiently  reasonable  or
important.    See  M.  Barnes  &  E.  Chemerinsky,  The  Once
and  Future  Equal  Protection  Doctrine?,  43  Conn.  L. Rev.
1059,  1080  (2011)  (“The  levels  of  scrutiny  are  essentially
balancing tests”).

To  begin,  as  I  have  explained,  that  kind  of  balancing
approach  to  constitutional  interpretation  departs  from
what Framers such as Madison stated, what jurists such as
Marshall  and  Scalia  did,  what  judges  as  umpires  should

Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)

KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

strive to do, and what this Court has actually done across
the constitutional landscape for the last two centuries.

The  balancing  tests  (heightened  scrutiny  and  the  like)
are a relatively modern judicial innovation in constitutional
decisionmaking.  The “tiers of scrutiny have no basis in the
text or original meaning of the Constitution.”  J. Alicea & J.
Ohlendorf,  Against  the  Tiers  of  Constitutional  Scrutiny,
National Affairs 72, 73 (2019).  And before the late 1950s,
“what  we  would  now  call  strict  judicial  scrutiny  did  not
exist.”  R. Fallon, The Nature of Constitutional Rights: The
Invention and Logic of Strict Judicial Scrutiny 30 (2019).
The Court “appears to have adopted” heightened-scrutiny
tests  “by  accident”  in  the  1950s  and  1960s  in  a  series  of
Communist  speech  cases,  “rather  than  as  the  result  of  a
considered judgment.”  Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members
of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 125 (1991)
(Kennedy,  J.,  concurring  in  judgment).    The  Court  has
employed balancing only in discrete areas of constitutional
law—and even in those cases, history still tends to play a
far larger role than overt judicial policymaking.7

To be clear, I am not suggesting that the Court overrule
cases  where  the  Court  has  applied  those  heightened-
scrutiny tests.  But I am challenging the notion that those

——————

7 The Court has articulated a heightened-scrutiny test in some pockets
of  free-speech  jurisprudence.    But  even  when  invoking  heightened
scrutiny in that context, the Court still often relies directly on history.
See, e.g., City of Austin v. Reagan Nat. Advertising of Austin, LLC, 596
U. S.  61,  75  (2022)  (a  city’s  regulation  of  solely  off-premises  billboards
was  within  “the  Nation’s  history  of  regulating  off-premises  signs”  as
“federal, state, and local jurisdictions have repeatedly relied upon on-/off-
premises  distinctions”  “for  the  last  50-plus  years”);  Perry  Ed.  Assn.  v.
Perry  Local  Educators’  Assn.,  460  U. S.  37,  45–46  (1983)  (“In  places
which by long tradition” “have been devoted to assembly and debate, the
rights  of  the  State  to
limit  expressive  activity  are  sharply
circumscribed”).  The Court has also used heightened scrutiny in certain
equal protection cases.  As discussed above, the Equal Protection Clause
rejected the history of racially discriminatory laws and practices.

the  ordinary  approach

tests  are
to  constitutional
interpretation.  And I am arguing against extending those
tests to new areas, including the Second Amendment.

One  major  problem  with  using  a balancing  approach  to
determine  exceptions  to  constitutional  rights  is  that  it
requires  highly  subjective  judicial  evaluations  of  how
important a law is—at least unless the balancing test itself
incorporates history, in which case judges might as well just
continue to rely on history directly.

The  subjective  balancing  approach  forces  judges  to  act
more  like  legislators  who  decide  what  the  law  should  be,
rather than judges who “say what the law is.”  Marbury v.
Madison,  1  Cranch  137,  177  (1803).    That  is  because  the
balancing approach requires judges to weigh the benefits of
a law against its burdens—a value-laden and political task
that is usually reserved for the political branches.  And that
power in essence vests judges with “a roving commission to
second-guess”
legislators  and  administrative  officers
“concerning  what  is  best  for  the  country.”    W.  Rehnquist,
The Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 Texas L. Rev. 693,
698 (1976).  Stated otherwise, when a court “does not have
a  solid  textual  anchor  or  an  established  social  norm  from
which  to  derive  the  general  rule,  its  pronouncement
appears  uncomfortably  like  legislation.”    A.  Scalia,  The
Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1185
(1989).

Moreover,  the  balancing  approach  is  ill-defined.    Some
judges will apply heightened scrutiny with a presumption
in favor of deference to the legislature.  Other judges will
apply  heightened  scrutiny  with  a  presumption  in  favor  of
the individual right in question.  Because it is unmoored,
the  balancing  approach  presents  the  real  “danger”  that
“judges will mistake their own predilections for the law.”  A.
Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849,
863 (1989).  Under the balancing approach, to use Justice
Scalia’s  characteristically  vivid  description,  if  “We  The

Court  conclude  that  They  The  People’s  answers  to  a
problem” are unwise, “we are free to intervene,” but if we
“think the States may be on to something, we can loosen the
leash.”  McDonald  v.  Chicago,  561  U. S.  742,  803  (2010)
(concurring opinion) (quotation marks omitted).

The  balancing  approach  can  be  antithetical  to  the
principle that judges must act like umpires.  It turns judges
into players.  Justice Black once protested that the Court
should not balance away bedrock free speech protections for
the perceived policy needs of the moment.  He argued that
“the  balancing  approach”  “disregards  all  of  the  unique
features  of  our  Constitution”  by  giving  “the  Court,  along
with Congress, a greater power, that of overriding the plain
commands  of  the  Bill  of  Rights  on  a  finding  of  weighty
public interest.”  H. Black, The Bill of Rights, 35 N. Y. U. L.
Rev. 865, 878–879 (1960).  Like Justice Black, the Court in
Heller cautioned that a “constitutional guarantee subject to
future
is  no
constitutional guarantee at all.”  554 U. S. 570, 634 (2008).
Some respond that history can be difficult to decipher.  It
is true that using history to interpret vague text can require
“nuanced  judgments,”  McDonald,  561  U. S.,  at  803–804
(Scalia,  J.,  concurring),  and  is  “sometimes  inconclusive,”
Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev., at
864.  But at a minimum, history tends to narrow the range
of  possible  meanings  that  may  be  ascribed  to  vague
constitutional  language.  A  history-based  methodology

The historical approach is not perfect.  But “the question
to be decided is not whether the historically focused method
is  a  perfect  means  of  restraining  aristocratic  judicial
Constitution-writing;  but  whether  it  is  the  best  means
available in an imperfect world.”  McDonald, 561 U. S., at
804 (Scalia, J., concurring) (emphasis in original).  And the

22

historical  approach  is  superior  to  judicial  policymaking.
The historical approach “depends upon a body of evidence
susceptible  of  reasoned  analysis  rather  than  a  variety  of
vague  ethico-political  First  Principles  whose  combined
conclusion can be found to point in any direction the judges
favor.”  Ibid.  Moreover, the historical approach “intrudes
less  upon  the  democratic  process  because  the  rights  it
acknowledges  are  those  established  by  a  constitutional
history  formed  by  democratic  decisions;  and  the  rights  it
fails to acknowledge are left to be democratically adopted or
rejected by the people.”  Id., at 805.

Amendment  was  incorporated  against  the  States.  In  so
holding,
presumed
constitutionality of the “longstanding regulatory measures”
identified  in  Heller.  561  U. S.  742,  786  (2010)  (plurality
opinion).
  Then,  in  Bruen,  the  Court  repeated  that  the  “Nation’s
historical  tradition  of  firearm  regulation”  guides  the
constitutional analysis of gun regulations and exceptions to
the right to bear arms.  597 U. S. 1, 17 (2022); see id., at 79–
81 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring).

This  Court’s  approach  in  those  three  recent  Second
Amendment  cases—and  in  the  Court’s  opinion  today—is
entirely  consistent  with  the  Court’s  longstanding  reliance
on history and precedent to determine the meaning of vague
constitutional  text.  Heller  rested  on  “constitutional  text
and history,” ante, at 6 (quotation marks omitted), and laid
the foundation for McDonald and then Bruen.

In  today’s  case,  the  Court  carefully  builds  on  Heller,
McDonald, and Bruen.  The Court applies the historical test
that those precedents have set forth—namely, “whether the
new law is relevantly similar to laws that our tradition is
understood  to  permit.”  Ante,  at  7  (quotation  marks
omitted).  The Court  examines “our historical tradition of
firearm  regulation,”  ante,  at  6  (quotation  marks  omitted),
and  correctly  holds  that  America’s  “tradition  of  firearm
regulation  allows  the  Government  to  disarm  individuals
who  present  a  credible  threat  to  the  physical  safety  of
others,” ante, at 16.  The law before us “fits neatly within
the tradition the surety and going armed laws represent.”
Ante, at 13–14.

As the Court’s decision today notes, Second Amendment

jurisprudence is still in the relatively early innings, unlike
the  First,  Fourth,  and  Sixth  Amendments,  for  example.
That is because the Court did not have occasion to recognize
the  Second  Amendment’s  individual  right  until  recently.
See generally Heller v. District of Columbia, 670 F. 3d 1244,
1269–1296  (CADC  2011)  (Kavanaugh,  J.,  dissenting).
Deciding  constitutional  cases  in  a  still-developing  area  of
this Court’s jurisprudence can sometimes be difficult.  But
that is not a permission slip for a judge to let constitutional
analysis morph into policy preferences under the guise of a
balancing  test  that  churns  out  the  judge’s  own  policy
beliefs.

the trade for an American judge interpreting the American
Constitution.  Of course, difficult subsidiary questions can

particular  cases.  And  in  some  cases,  text,  history,  and
precedent may point in somewhat different directions.  In

UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[June 21, 2024]

JUSTICE BARRETT, concurring.
Despite  its  unqualified  text,  the  Second  Amendment  is
not  absolute.    It  codified  a  pre-existing  right,  and  pre-
existing limits on that right are part and parcel of it.  Dis-
trict of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 595, 627 (2008).
Those limits define the scope of “the right to bear arms” as
it was originally understood; to identify them, courts must
examine  our  “historical  tradition  of  firearm  regulation.”
New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S.
1, 17, 19 (2022).  That evidence marks where the right stops
and the State’s authority to regulate begins.  A regulation
is  constitutional  only  if  the  government  affirmatively
proves that it is “consistent with the Second Amendment’s
text and historical understanding.”  Id., at 26.

Because the Court has taken an originalist approach to
the Second Amendment, it is worth pausing to identify the
basic  premises  of  originalism.    The  theory  is  built  on  two
core  principles:  that  the  meaning  of  constitutional  text  is
fixed at the time of its ratification and that the “discovera-
ble historical meaning . . . has legal significance and is au-
thoritative  in  most  circumstances.”    K.  Whittington,
Originalism: A Critical Introduction, 82 Ford. L. Rev. 375,
378 (2013) (Whittington).  Ratification is a democratic act
that  renders  constitutional  text  part  of  our  fundamental
law, see Arts. V, VII, and that text “remains law until law-

fully altered,” S. Sachs, Originalism: Standard and Proce-
dure, 135 Harv. L. Rev. 777, 782 (2022).  So for an original-
ist, the history that matters most is the history surrounding
the  ratification  of  the  text;  that  backdrop  illuminates  the
meaning of the enacted law.  History (or tradition) that long
postdates  ratification does  not  serve  that  function.    To be
sure, postenactment history can be an important tool.  For
example, it can “reinforce our understanding of the Consti-
tution’s original meaning”; “liquidate ambiguous constitu-
tional provisions”; provide persuasive evidence of the origi-
nal  meaning;  and,  if  stare  decisis  applies,  control  the
outcome.  See Vidal v. Elster, 602 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2024)
(BARRETT, J., concurring in part) (slip op., at 13–14).  But
generally  speaking,  the  use  of  postenactment  history  re-
quires some justification other than originalism simpliciter.
In Bruen, the Court took history beyond the founding era,
considering gun regulations that spanned the 19th century.
597  U. S.,  at  50–70.    I  expressed  reservations  about  the
scope of that inquiry but concluded that the timing question
did not matter to Bruen’s holding.  Id., at 81–83 (concurring
opinion).    It  bears  emphasis,  however,  that  my  questions
were about the time period relevant to discerning the Sec-
ond Amendment’s original meaning—for instance, what is
the post-1791 cutoff for discerning how the Second Amend-
ment was originally understood?  Id., at 82 (“How long after
ratification  may  subsequent  practice  illuminate  original
public meaning?”).  My doubts were not about whether “tra-
dition,” standing alone, is dispositive.  Id., at 83 (“[T]oday’s
decision should not be understood to endorse freewheeling
reliance  on  historical  practice  from  the  mid-to-late  19th
century  to  establish  the  original  meaning  of  the  Bill  of
Rights”).  As I have explained elsewhere, evidence of “tradi-
tion” unmoored from original meaning is not binding law.
Vidal,  602  U. S.,  at  ___–___  (BARRETT,  J.,  concurring  in
part) (slip op., at 13–15).  And scattered cases or regulations
pulled from history may have little bearing on the meaning

of the text.  Samia v. United States, 599 U. S. 635, 656–657
(2023) (BARRETT, J., concurring in part and  concurring in
judgment).
  “Original history”—i.e., the generally dispositive kind—
plays two roles in the Second Amendment context.  It eluci-
dates how contemporaries understood the text—for exam-
ple, the meaning of the phrase “bear Arms.”  See Heller, 554
U. S., at 582–592.  It also plays the more complicated role
of determining the scope of the pre-existing right that the
people  enshrined  in  our  fundamental  law.*    In  Rahimi’s
case,  the  Court  uses  history  in  this  latter  way.  Call  this
“original contours” history: It looks at historical gun regu-
lations to identify the contours of the right.

Courts have struggled with this use of history in the wake
of  Bruen.  One  difficulty  is  a  level  of  generality  problem:
Must the government produce a founding-era relative of the
challenged regulation—if not a twin, a cousin?  Or do found-
ing-era gun regulations yield concrete principles that mark
the borders of the right?

Many  courts,  including  the  Fifth  Circuit,  have  under-
stood Bruen to require the former, narrower approach.  But
Bruen emphasized that “analogical reasoning” is not a “reg-
ulatory straightjacket.”  597 U. S., at 30.  To be consistent
with historical limits, a challenged regulation need not be

——————

*To  my  mind,  this  use  of  history  walks  a  fine  line  between  original
meaning (which controls) and expectations about how the text would ap-
ply (which do not).  See Whittington 383 (“Specific expectations about the
consequences  of  a  legal  rule  are  distinct  from  the  meaning  of  the  rule
itself ”).  Contemporary  government  actors  might  have  been  “wrong
about the consequences of their own constitutional rule,” or they “might
not have fully and faithfully implemented the adopted constitutional rule
themselves.”  Id., at 384.  Thus, while early applications of a constitu-
tional rule can help illuminate its original scope, an interpreter must ex-
ercise care in considering them.  Id., at 385–386.  In the Second Amend-
ment context, particular gun regulations—even if from the ratification
era—do not themselves have the status of constitutional law.

an updated model of a historical counterpart.  Besides, im-
posing  a  test  that  demands  overly  specific  analogues  has
serious problems.  To name two: It forces 21st-century reg-
ulations to follow late-18th-century policy choices, giving us
“a law trapped in amber.”  Ante, at 7.  And it assumes that
founding-era legislatures maximally exercised their power
to regulate, thereby adopting a “use it or lose it” view of leg-
islative  authority.    Such  assumptions  are  flawed,  and
originalism does not require them.

“Analogical  reasoning”  under  Bruen  demands  a  wider
lens: Historical regulations reveal a principle, not a mold.
See, e.g., 597 U. S., at 28–29 (explaining that the Amend-
ment does not apply only to the catalogue of arms that ex-
isted  in the 18th century, but rather to all weapons satis-
fying the “general definition” of “bearable arms” (emphasis
added));  id.,  at  30–31  (discussing  the  “ ‘sensitive  places’ ”
principle that limits the right to public carry); cf. Vidal, 602
U. S., at ___–___ (BARRETT, J., concurring in part) (slip op.,
at 7–9); Whittington 386 (“The insight to be gleaned is not
the authoritative status of the expected application, but the
apparent rule at play given that such an application is ex-
pected to follow from it”).  To be sure, a court must be care-
ful not to read a principle at such a high level of generality
that it waters down the right.  Pulling principle from prec-
edent, whether case law or history, is a standard feature of
legal reasoning, and reasonable minds sometimes disagree
about how broad or narrow the controlling principle should
be.

Here, though, the Court settles on just the right level of
generality: “Since the founding, our Nation’s firearm laws
have  included  provisions  preventing  individuals  who
threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms.”
Ante, at 5; see also Kanter v. Barr, 919 F. 3d 437, 451, 464–
465  (CA7  2019)  (Barrett,  J.,  dissenting)  (“History  is  con-

tures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from pos-
sessing guns”).  Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i) fits well within that
principle; therefore, Rahimi’s facial challenge fails.  Harder
level-of-generality problems can await another day.

UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[June 21, 2024]

JUSTICE JACKSON, concurring.
This case tests our Second Amendment jurisprudence as
shaped in particular by New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn.,
Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. 1 (2022).  I disagree with the meth-
odology of that decision; I would have joined the dissent had
I been a Member of the Court at that time.  See generally
id.,  at  83–133  (Breyer,  J.,  dissenting).    But  Bruen  is  now
binding law.  Today’s decision fairly applies that precedent,
so I join the opinion in full.

I write separately because we now have two years’ worth
of post-Bruen cases under our belts, and the experiences of
courts  applying  its  history-and-tradition  test  should  bear
on our assessment of the workability of that legal standard.
This case highlights the apparent difficulty faced by judges
on the ground.  Make no mistake: Today’s effort to clear up
“misunderst[andings],” ante, at 7, is a tacit admission that
lower courts are struggling.  In my view, the blame may lie
with us, not with them.

I
The  Court  today  expounds  on  the  history-and-tradition
inquiry that Bruen requires.  Ante, at 7–8.  We emphasize
that  the  Second  Amendment  is  “not  . . .  a  law  trapped  in
amber.”  Ante, at 7.  It “permits more than just those regu-
lations  identical  to  ones  that  could  be  found  in  1791”;  in-
deed,  “a  challenged  regulation  [that]  does  not  precisely

JACKSON, J., concurring

match its historical precursors . . . ‘still may be analogous
enough  to  pass  constitutional  muster.’ ”    Ibid.  (quoting
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30).  Gun regulations need only “com-
port  with  the  principles  underlying  the  Second  Amend-
ment.”  Ante, at 7–8.  These clarifying efforts are welcome,
given the many questions Bruen left unanswered.

When this Court adopts a new legal standard, as we did
in Bruen, we do not do so in a vacuum.  The tests we estab-
lish  bind  lower  court  judges,  who  then  apply  those  legal
standards  to  the  cases  before  them.  In  my  view,  as  this
Court thinks of, and speaks about, history’s relevance to the
interpretation  of  constitutional  provisions,  we  should  be
mindful that our common-law tradition of promoting clarity
and consistency in the application of our precedent also has
a lengthy pedigree.  So when courts signal they are having
trouble with one of our standards, we should pay attention.
Cf. Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,
469 U. S. 528, 538–539 (1985).

The message that lower courts are sending now in Second
Amendment cases could not be clearer.  They say there is
little method to Bruen’s madness.1  It isn’t just that Bruen’s

history-and-tradition test is burdensome (though that is no
small thing to courts with heavier caseloads and fewer re-
sources than we have).  The more worrisome concern is that
lower courts appear to be diverging in both approach and
outcome as they struggle to conduct the inquiry Bruen re-

Bruen’s approach have been unable to produce “consistent,

II
This  discord  is  striking  when  compared  to  the  relative
harmony that had developed prior to Bruen.  To be sure, our
decision  in  District  of  Columbia  v.  Heller,  554  U. S.  570
(2008),  which  first  recognized  an  individual  right  to  keep
and bear arms for self-defense, see id., at 628, was disrup-
tive in its own way.  After all, before Heller, “[t]he meaning
of the Second Amendment ha[d] been considered settled by
courts and legislatures for over two centuries,” and “judges
and  legislators  . . .  properly  believed  . . .  that  the  Second
Amendment did not reach possession of firearms for purely
private activities.”  Id., at 676, n. 38 (Stevens, J., dissent-
ing).  Nonetheless,  after  Heller,  lower  courts  took  up  the
necessary  work  of  reviewing  burdens  on  this  newly  un-
earthed right.  By the time this Court decided Bruen, every
court  of  appeals  evaluating  whether  a  firearm  regulation
was consistent with the Second Amendment did so using a
two-step framework that incorporated means-end scrutiny.
See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 103 (Breyer, J., dissenting).

Rejecting  that  “two-step  approach”  as  having  “one  step
too many,” id., at 19, the Bruen majority subbed in another
two-step evaluation.  Courts must, first, determine whether
“the Second Amendment’s plain text covers an individual’s
conduct.”  Id., at 24.  If it does, “[t]he government must then
justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent
with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
Ibid.

No one seems to question that “[h]istory has a role to play
in Second Amendment analysis.”  Ante, at 4 (SOTOMAYOR,
J., concurring).  But, per Bruen, courts evaluating a Second
Amendment  challenge  must  consider  history  to  the  exclu-
sion of all else.  This means legislators must locate and pro-
duce—and courts must sift through—troves of centuries-old
documentation looking for supportive historical evidence.2

JACKSON, J., concurring

This very case provides a prime example of the pitfalls of
Bruen’s approach.  Having been told that a key marker of a
constitutional gun regulation is “a well-established and rep-
resentative  historical  analogue,”  Bruen,  597  U. S.,  at  30
(emphasis deleted), Rahimi argued below that “there is lit-
tle  or  no  historical  evidence  suggesting  disarmament  for
those  who  committed  domestic  violence;  and  there  is  cer-
tainly no tradition of disarming people subject to a no-con-
tact order related to domestic violence.”  Supp. Brief for Ap-
pellant  in  No.  21–11001  (CA5),  p. 15  (emphasis  deleted).
The  Government  then  proffered  what  it  maintained  were
sufficient historical analogues to 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(8), in-
cluding surety and going armed laws.  Supp. Brief for Ap-
pellee in No. 21–11001 (CA5), pp. 23, n. 2, 27–31.  But the
Fifth Circuit concluded that the federal statute was uncon-
stitutional  because  the  Government’s  analogues  were  not
“ ‘relevantly similar.’ ”  61 F. 4th 443, 460–461 (2023).

Neither the parties nor the Fifth Circuit had the benefit
of today’s decision, in which we hold that the Government
had in fact offered “ample evidence that the Second Amend-
ment  permits  the  disarmament  of  individuals  who  pose  a
credible threat to the physical safety of others.”  Ante, at 8.
But even setting aside whether the historical examples the
Government  found  were  sufficiently  analogous,  just  can-
vassing the universe of historical records and gauging the
sufficiency of such evidence is an exceedingly difficult task.3

not ordinarily have the specialized education, knowledge, or training of
professional historians) to engage in this kind of assessment.  And dutiful
legislators are not the only stakeholders who are far outside their depth:
Bruen also conscripts parties and judges into service as amateur histori-
ans, casting about for similar historical circumstances.

3 The mad scramble for historical records that Bruen requires also sug-
gests that only those solutions that States implemented in the distant
past  comport  with  the  Constitution.    That  premise  is  questionable  be-
cause,  given  the  breadth  of  some  of  the  Constitution’s  provisions,  it  is
likely that the Founders understood that new solutions would be needed
over  time,  even  for  traditional  problems,  and  that  the  principles  they

6

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

JACKSON, J., concurring

Consistent analyses and outcomes are likely to remain elu-
sive because whether Bruen’s test is satisfied in a particular
case seems to depend on the suitability of whatever histor-
ical sources the parties can manage to cobble together, as
well  as  the  level  of  generality  at  which  a  court  evaluates
those sources—neither of which we have as yet adequately
clarified.

And the unresolved questions hardly end there.  Who is
protected by the Second Amendment, from a historical per-
spective?  To what conduct does the Second Amendment’s
plain  text  apply?  To  what  historical  era  (or  eras)  should
courts look to divine a historical tradition of gun regulation?
How many analogues add up to a tradition?  Must there be
evidence that those analogues were enforced or subject to
judicial  scrutiny?    How  much  support  can  nonstatutory
sources  lend?  I  could  go  on—as  others  have.    See,  e.g.,
United States v. Daniels, 77 F. 4th 337, 358–360 (CA5 2023)
(Higginson,  J.,  concurring)  (providing  a  similarly  nonex-
haustive list).  But I won’t.

Maybe  time  will  resolve  these  and  other  key  questions.
Maybe appellate courts, including ours, will find a way to
“[b]rin[g] discipline to the increasingly erratic and unprin-
cipled body of law that is emerging after Bruen.”  J. Blocher

doubt that the Framers “intended future generations to ignore [modern-
day] matters”).  It stifles both helpful innovation and democratic engage-
ment to read the Constitution to prevent advancement in this way.  In
any event, what we see now is that Bruen’s history-and-tradition test is
not  only  limiting  legislative  solutions,  it  also  appears  to  be  creating
chaos.

that foster stability, facilitate consistency, and promote pre-
dictability.  So far, Bruen’s history-focused test ticks none
of those boxes.

I concur in today’s decision applying Bruen.  But, in my
view,  the  Court  should  also  be  mindful  of  how  its  legal
standards  are  actually  playing  out  in  real  life.    We  must
remember  that  legislatures,  seeking  to  implement  mean-
ingful  reform  for  their  constituents  while  simultaneously
respecting the Second Amendment, are hobbled without a
clear,  workable  test  for  assessing  the  constitutionality  of
their proposals.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 54–57; cf. Bruen, 597
U. S., at 90–91 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  And courts, which
are currently at sea when it comes to evaluating firearms
legislation, need a solid anchor for grounding their consti-
tutional pronouncements.  The public, too, deserves clarity
when this Court interprets our Constitution.

4 Extremely  pertinent  inquiries  relevant  to  consistent  application  of
Bruen’s standard await resolution.  For example, in Bruen we acknowl-
edged  the  existence  of  “an  ongoing  scholarly  debate  on  whether courts
should primarily rely on the prevailing understanding of an individual
right when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868 when defin-
ing its scope (as well as the scope of the right against the Federal Gov-
ernment).”    597  U. S.,  at  37.    We  saw  no  need  to  address  the  issue  in
Bruen.  Id.,  at  38.  We  similarly  decline  to  resolve  that  dispute  today.

UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

[June 21, 2024]

JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.
After New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen,
597 U. S. 1 (2022), this Court’s directive was clear: A fire-
arm regulation that falls within the Second Amendment’s
plain text is unconstitutional unless it is consistent with the
Nation’s  historical  tradition  of  firearm  regulation.  Not  a
single historical regulation justifies the statute at issue, 18
U. S. C. §922(g)(8).  Therefore, I respectfully dissent.

I
Section 922(g)(8) makes it unlawful for an individual who
is subject to a civil restraining order to possess firearms or
ammunition.  To trigger §922(g)(8)’s prohibition, a restrain-
ing order must bear three characteristics.  First, the order
issues  after  a  hearing  where  the  accused  “received
actual  notice”  and  had  “an  opportunity  to  participate.”
§922(g)(8)(A).  Second, the order restrains the accused from
engaging in threatening behavior against an intimate part-
ner or child.  §922(g)(8)(B).  Third, the order has either “a
finding  that  [the  accused]  represents  a  credible  threat  to
the physical safety of [an] intimate partner or child,” or an
“explici[t]  prohibit[ion]”  on  “the  use,  attempted  use,  or
threatened use of physical force against [an] intimate part-
ner or child.”  §922(g)(8)(C).  If those three characteristics
are  present,  §922(g)(8)  automatically  bans  the  individual

2

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

subject to the order from possessing “any firearm or ammu-
nition.”  §922(g).

Just as important as §922(g)(8)’s express terms is what it
leaves unsaid.  Section 922(g)(8) does not require a finding
that a person has ever committed a crime of domestic vio-
lence.  It is not triggered by a criminal conviction or a per-
son’s  criminal  history,  unlike  other  §922(g)  subsections.
See  §§922(g)(1),  (9).  And,  §922(g)(8)  does  not  distinguish
contested orders from joint orders—for example, when par-
ties voluntarily enter a no-contact agreement or when both
parties seek a restraining order.

In addition, §922(g)(8) strips an individual of his ability
to possess firearms and ammunition without any due pro-
cess.1  Rather, the ban is an automatic, uncontestable con-
sequence of certain orders.  See §922(g) (“It shall be unlaw-
ful  for  any  [qualifying]  person  [to]  possess  in  or  affecting
commerce, any firearm or ammunition”).  There is no hear-
ing or opportunity to be heard on the statute’s applicability,
and a court need not decide whether a person should be dis-
armed  under  §922(g)(8).  The  only  process  §922(g)(8)  re-
quires is that provided (or not) for the underlying restrain-
ing order.

Despite  §922(g)(8)’s  broad  scope  and  lack  of  process,  it
carries strong penalties.  Any violation of §922(g)(8) is a fel-
imprisonment.
ony  punishable  by  up  to  15  years’
§924(a)(8); see also ante, at 3.  And, a conviction for violat-
ing §922(g)(8) itself triggers a permanent, life-long prohibi-
tion  on  possessing  firearms  and  ammunition.
See
§922(g)(1).

In 2020, Zackey Rahimi and his ex-girlfriend, C. M., en-
tered into a qualifying civil restraining order.  App. 1.  C. M.
had  requested  the  order  and  asserted  that  Rahimi  as-
saulted  her.   See  id.,  at  2.  Because  the  order  found  that

whether §922(g)(8) satisfies the Due Process Clause.

THOMAS, J., dissenting

Rahimi presented a credible threat and prohibited him from
using physical force against C. M., the order automatically
triggered  §922(g)(8)’s  firearms  ban.    A  year  later,  officers
discovered  firearms  in  Rahimi’s  home.  Rahimi  pleaded
guilty to violating §922(g)(8).

Before his guilty plea, Rahimi challenged his conviction
under  the  Second  Amendment.    He  pointed  to  District  of
Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570 (2008), which held that
the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep
and bear firearms.  Section 922(g)(8), Rahimi argued, vio-
lates that right by penalizing firearms possession.  The Dis-
trict  Court  rejected  Rahimi’s  claim.    At  that  time,  the
Courts  of  Appeals,  including  the  Fifth  Circuit,  applied  a
form of means-end scrutiny to Second Amendment claims.
See, e.g., United States v. McGinnis, 956 F. 3d 747, 753–754
(2020).  Applying  Circuit  precedent,  the  Fifth  Circuit  af-
firmed the District Court.  2022 WL 2070392 (2022).

Roughly two weeks later, this Court issued its opinion in
New  York  State  Rifle  &  Pistol  Assn.,  Inc.  v.  Bruen.  The
Court  rejected  the  means-end-scrutiny  approach  and  laid
out the appropriate framework for assessing whether a fire-
arm regulation is constitutional.  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 17–
19.  That framework requires the Government to prove that
the “regulation is part of the historical tradition that delim-
its  the  outer  bounds  of  the  right  to  keep  and  bear  arms.”
Id., at 19.  The Fifth Circuit withdrew its opinion to apply
the correct framework to Rahimi’s claim.  Relying on Bruen,
the Fifth Circuit concluded that the Government failed to
present historical evidence that §922(g)(8) “fits within our
Nation’s  historical  tradition  of  firearm  regulation.”    61  F.
4th 443, 460 (2023).  The Fifth Circuit, accordingly, vacated
Rahimi’s conviction.  We granted certiorari.  600 U. S. ___
(2023).

II
The Second Amendment provides that “[a] well regulated

4

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be in-
fringed.”  As  the  Court  recognizes,  Bruen  provides  the
framework  for  analyzing  whether  a  regulation  such  as
§922(g)(8)  violates  the  Second  Amendment’s  mandate.
“[W]hen the Second Amendment’s plain text covers an indi-
vidual’s  conduct,  the  Constitution  presumptively  protects
that conduct.”  597 U. S., at 17.  To overcome this presump-
tion,  “the  government  must  demonstrate  that  the  regula-
tion  is  consistent  with  the  Nation’s  historical  tradition  of
firearm  regulation.”    Ibid.  The  presumption  against  re-
strictions on keeping and bearing firearms is a central fea-
ture of the Second Amendment.  That Amendment does not
merely narrow the Government’s regulatory power.  It is a
barrier, placing the right to keep and bear arms off limits
to the Government.

When  considering  whether  a  modern  regulation  is  con-
sistent with historical regulations and thus overcomes the
presumption against firearms restrictions, our precedents
“point toward at least two metrics [of comparison]: how and
why the regulations burden a law-abiding citizen’s right to
armed self-defense.”  Id., at 29.  A historical law must sat-
isfy both considerations to serve as a comparator.  See ibid.
While  a  historical  law  need  not  be  a  “historical  twin,”  it
must be “well-established and representative” to serve as a
historical analogue.  Id., at 30 (emphasis deleted).

In  some  cases,  “the  inquiry  [is]  fairly  straightforward.”
Id., at 26.  For instance, “when a challenged regulation ad-
dresses a general societal problem that has persisted since
the 18th century, the lack of a distinctly similar historical
regulation  addressing  that  problem  is  relevant  evidence
that the challenged regulation is inconsistent with the Sec-
ond  Amendment.  Likewise,  if  earlier  generations  ad-
dressed the societal problem, but did so through materially
different means, that also could be evidence that a modern
regulation is unconstitutional.”  Id., at 26–27.

THOMAS, J., dissenting

The  Court  employed  this  “straightforward”  analysis  in
Heller and Bruen.  Heller considered the District of Colum-
bia’s “flat ban on the possession of handguns in the home,”
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 27, and Bruen considered New York’s
effective ban on carrying a firearm in public, see id., at 11–
13.  The  Court  determined  that  the  District  of  Columbia
and  New  York  had  “addressed  a  perceived  societal  prob-
lem—firearm violence in densely populated communities—
and  [they]  employed  a  regulation  . . .  that  the  Founders
themselves could have adopted to confront that problem.”
Id., at 27.  Accordingly, the Court “consider[ed] ‘founding-
era historical precedent’ ” and looked for a comparable reg-
ulation.  Ibid. (quoting Heller, 554 U. S., at 631).  In both
cases,  the  Court  found  no  such  law  and  held  the  modern
regulations unconstitutional.  Id., at 631; Bruen, 597 U. S.,
at 27.

Under  our  precedent,  then,  we  must  resolve  two  ques-
tions to determine if §922(g)(8) violates the Second Amend-
ment:  (1) Does  §922(g)(8)  target  conduct  protected  by  the
Second  Amendment’s  plain  text;  and  (2) does  the  Govern-
ment  establish  that  §922(g)(8)  is  consistent  with  the  Na-
tion’s historical tradition of firearm regulation?

III

Section 922(g)(8) violates the Second Amendment.  First,
it targets conduct at the core of the Second Amendment—
possessing firearms.  Second, the Government failed to pro-
duce any evidence that §922(g)(8) is consistent with the Na-
tion’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.  To the con-
trary, the founding generation addressed the same societal
problem  as  §922(g)(8)  through  the  “materially  different
means” of surety laws.  Id., at 26.

A
It  is  undisputed  that  §922(g)(8)  targets  conduct  encom-
passed  by  the  Second  Amendment’s  plain  text.  After  all,

6

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

the  statute  bans  a  person  subject  to  a  restraining  order
from possessing or using virtually any firearm or ammuni-
tion.  §922(g)  (prohibiting  covered  individuals  from  “pos-
sess[ing]” or “receiv[ing] any firearm or ammunition which
has  been  shipped  or  transported  in  interstate  or  foreign
commerce”).  A  covered  individual  cannot  even  possess  a
firearm in his home for self-defense, “the central component
of the [Second Amendment] right itself.”  Heller, 554 U. S.,
at 599 (emphasis deleted).  There is no doubt that §922(g)(8)
is irreconcilable with the Second Amendment’s text.  Id., at
628–629.

It is also undisputed that the Second Amendment applies
to Rahimi.  By its terms, the Second Amendment extends
to “ ‘the people,’ ” and that “term unambiguously refers to all
members  of  the  political  community,  not  an  unspecified
subset.”  Id., at 580.  The Second Amendment thus recog-
nizes a right “guaranteed to ‘all Americans.’ ”  Bruen, 597
U. S., at 70 (quoting Heller, 554 U. S., at 581).  Since Rahimi
is a member of the political community, he falls within the
Second Amendment’s guarantee.

B
The Government fails to carry its burden of proving that
§922(g)(8) is “consistent with the Nation’s historical tradi-
tion of firearm regulation.”  597 U. S., at 24.  Despite can-
vassing laws before, during, and after our Nation’s found-
ing,  the  Government  does  not  identify  even  a  single
regulation with an analogous burden and justification.2

The  Government’s  failure  is  unsurprising  given  that

——————

2 I  agree  with  the  majority  that  we  need  not  address  the  “ ‘ongoing
scholarly debate on whether courts should primarily rely on the prevail-
ing understanding of an individual right when the Fourteenth Amend-
ment was ratified in 1868 when defining its scope (as well as the scope
of the right against the Federal Government).’ ”  Ante, at 8, n. 1 (quoting

THOMAS, J., dissenting

§922(g)(8) addresses a societal problem—the risk of inter-
personal violence—“that has persisted since the 18th cen-
tury,” yet was addressed “through [the] materially different
means” of surety laws.  Id., at 26.  Surety laws were, in a
nutshell, a fine on certain behavior.  If a person threatened
someone in his community, he was given the choice to either
keep the peace or forfeit a sum of money.  Surety laws thus
shared  the  same  justification  as  §922(g)(8),  but  they  im-
posed a far less onerous burden.  The Government has not
shown that §922(g)(8)’s more severe approach is consistent
with our historical tradition of firearm regulation.

1
The Government does not offer a single historical regula-
tion that is relevantly similar to §922(g)(8).  As the Court
has  explained,  the  “central  considerations”  when  compar-
ing modern and historical regulations are whether the reg-
ulations “impose a comparable burden” that is “comparably
justified.”  Id., at 29.  The Government offers only two cate-
gories  of  evidence  that  are  even  within  the  ballpark  of
§922(g)(8)’s burden and justification: English laws disarm-
ing persons “dangerous” to the peace of the kingdom, and
commentary  discussing  peaceable  citizens  bearing  arms.
Neither category ultimately does the job.

i
The Government points to various English laws from the
late 1600s and early 1700s to argue that there is a tradition
of restricting the rights of “dangerous” persons.  For exam-
ple, the Militia Act of 1662 authorized local officials to dis-
arm individuals judged “dangerous to the Peace of the King-
dome.”  14  Car.  2  c.  3,  §13.    And,  in  the  early  1700s,  the
Crown authorized lords and justices of the peace to “cause
search to be made for arms in the possession of any persons
whom they judge dangerous, and seize such arms according
to  law.”  Calendar  of  State  Papers  Domestic:  William  III,

8

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

1700–1702, p. 234 (E. Bateson ed. 1937) (Calendar William
III).

At first glance, these laws targeting “dangerous” persons
might appear relevant.  After all, if the Second Amendment
right was historically understood to allow an official to dis-
arm  anyone  he  deemed  “dangerous,”  it  may  follow  that
modern Congresses can do the same.  Yet, historical context
compels the opposite conclusion.  The Second Amendment
stems from English resistance against “dangerous” person
laws.

The sweeping disarmament authority wielded by English
officials during the 1600s, including the Militia Act of 1662,
prompted  the  English  to  enshrine  an  individual  right  to
keep  and  bear  arms.  “[T]he  Stuart  Kings  Charles  II  and
James II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to
suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their op-
ponents.”  Heller, 554 U. S., at 592.  Englishmen, as a re-
sult,  grew  “to  be  extremely  wary  of  concentrated  military
forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms.”  Id.,
at 593.  Following the Glorious Revolution, they “obtained
an  assurance  . . .  in  the  Declaration  of  Right  (which  was
codified  as  the  English  Bill  of  Rights),  that  Protestants
would never be disarmed.”  Ibid.

The English Bill of Rights “has long been understood to
be  the  predecessor  to  our  Second  Amendment.”  Ibid.  In
fact,  our  Founders  expanded  on  it  and  made  the  Second
Amendment even more protective of individual liberty.  The
English Bill of Rights assured Protestants “Arms for their
Defence,” but only where “suitable to their Conditions and
as allowed by Law.”  1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 2, (1688), in 6 Stat-
utes of the Realm 143.  The Second Amendment, however,
contains  no  such  qualifiers  and  protects  the  right  of  “the
people” generally.  In short, laws targeting “dangerous” per-
sons  led  to  the  Second  Amendment.    It  would  be  passing
strange to permit the Government to resurrect those self-

THOMAS, J., dissenting

same “dangerous” person laws to chip away at that Amend-
ment’s guarantee.

Even on their own terms, laws targeting “dangerous” per-
sons cannot support §922(g)(8).  Those laws were driven by
a  justification  distinct  from  that  of  §922(g)(8)—quashing
treason and rebellion.  The Stuart Kings’ reign was marked
by religious and political conflict, which at that time were
often one and the same.  The Parliament of the late 1600s
“re-established an intolerant episcopalian church” through
legislation targeting other sects, including “[a] fierce penal
code” to keep those other sects out of local government and
“to criminalize nonconformist worship.”  Oxford Handbook
of the English Revolution 212 (M. Braddick ed. 2015) (Ox-
ford  Handbook);  see  G.  Clark,  The  Later  Stuarts  1660–
1714, p. 22 (2d ed. 1955).  These laws were driven in large
part by a desire to suppress rebellion.  “Nonconformist min-
isters  were  thought  to  preach  resistance  to  divinely  or-
dained monarchs.”  Oxford Handbook 212; see Calendar of
State  Papers  Domestic:  Charles  II,  1661–1662,  p. 161  (M.
Green  ed.  1861)  (Calendar  Charles  II)  (“[P]reachers  go
about from county to county, and blow the flames of rebel-
lion”).  Various nonconformist insurrections gave credibility
to  these  fears.    See,  e.g.,  Clark,  The  Later  Stuarts,  at  22;
Privy Council to Lord Newport (Mar. 4, 1661), in Transac-
tions of the Shropshire Archaeological and Natural History
Society, Pt. 2, 3d Ser., Vol. 4, p. 161 (1904).

It is in this turbulent context that the English kings per-
mitted the disarming of “dangerous persons.”  English lords
feared that nonconformists—i.e., people with “ ‘wicked and
Rebellious  Principles’ ”—had  “ ‘furnished  themselves  with
quantities of Arms, and Ammunition’ ” “ ‘to put in Execution
their Trayterus designs.’ ”  Privy Council to Lord Newport
(Jan. 8, 1660), in id., at 156; see Calendar Charles II 541
(“The  fanatics  . . .  are  high  and  insolent,  and  threaten  all
loyal people; they will soon be in arms”).  In response, the
Crown  took  measures  to  root  out  suspected  rebels,  which

10

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

included  “disarm[ing]  all  factious  and  seditious  spirits.”
Id., at 538 (Nov. 1, 1662).  For example, following “turbu-
lency and difficulties” arising from the Conventicles Act of
1670, which forbade religious nonconformists from assem-
bling, the lord mayor of London pressed that “a special war-
rant or commission [was] necessary” empowering commis-
sioners  to  “resist,  fight,  kill,  and  execute  such  rebels.”
Calendar  of  State  Papers,  Domestic  Series,  1670,  p.  236
(May  25,  1670)  (M.  Green  ed.  1895)  (emphasis  deleted).
King  Charles  II  ordered  the  lord  mayor  “to  make  strict
search  in  the  city  and  precincts  for  dangerous  and  disaf-
fected persons, seize and secure them and their arms, and
detain them in custody till our further pleasure.”  Id., at 237
(May 26, 1670).

History repeated itself a few decades later.  In 1701, King
William  III  declared  that  “great  quantities  of  arms,  and
other provisions of war” had been discovered in the hands
of “papists and other disaffected persons, who disown [the]
government,” and that such persons had begun to assemble
“in great numbers . . . in the cities of London and Westmin-
ster.”  Calendar William III 233.  He ordered the lord mayor
of London and the justices of the peace to “secur[e] the gov-
ernment”  by  disarming  “any  persons  whom  they  judge[d]
dangerous,” including “any papist, or reputed papist.”  Id.,
at 233–234 (emphasis deleted).  Similar disarmaments tar-
geting  “Papists  and  Non-jurors  dangerous  to  the  peace  of
the  kingdom”  continued  into  the  1700s.    Privy  Council  to
the  Earl  of  Carlisle  (July  30,  1714),  in  Historical  Manu-
scripts Comm’n, Manuscripts of the Earl of Westmoreland
et al.  10th  Report,  Appx.,  Pt.  4,  p.  343  (1885).    As  before,
disarmament was designed to stifle “wicked conspirac[ies],”
such as “raising a Rebellion in this Kingdom in favour of a
Popish Pretender.”  Lord Lonsdale to Deputy Lieutenants
of  Cumberland  (May  20,  1722),  in  Historical  Manuscripts
Commission, Manuscripts of the Earl of Carlisle, 15th Re-
port, Appx., Pt. 6, pp. 39–40 (1897).

While  the  English  were  concerned  about  preventing  in-
surrection  and  armed  rebellion,  §922(g)(8)  is  concerned
with preventing interpersonal violence.  “Dangerous” per-
son laws thus offer the Government no support.

ii
The Government also points to historical commentary re-
ferring to the right of “peaceable” citizens to carry arms.  It
principally  relies  on  commentary  surrounding  two  failed
constitutional proposals.3  First, at the Massachusetts con-
vention,  Samuel  Adams  unsuccessfully  proposed  that  the
Bill of Rights deny Congress the power “to prevent the peo-
ple of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from
keeping  their  own  arms.”    6  Documentary  History  of  the
Ratification  of  the  Constitution  1453  (J.  Kaminski  &  G.
Saladino eds. 2000) (Documentary History).  Second, Anti-
Federalists at the Pennsylvania convention unsuccessfully
proposed a Bill of Rights providing a “right to bear arms for
the defense of themselves and their own state, or the United
States, or for the purpose of killing game.”  2 id., at 597–
598, ¶7 (M. Jensen ed. 1976).  The Anti-Federalists’ Bill of
Rights would also state that “no law shall be passed for dis-
arming  the  people or  any  of  them,  unless  for  crimes  com-
mitted,  or  real  danger  of  public  injury  from  individuals.”

——————

3 The Government also cites an amendment to the Massachusetts Con-
stitution providing that “the people have a right to keep and to bear Arms
for their Own and the Common defence.”  The Popular Sources of Politi-
cal  Authority:  Documents  on  the  Massachusetts  Constitution  of  1780,
p. 624 (O. Handlin & M. Handlin eds. 1966).  The Government empha-
sizes that the amendment’s proponents believed they “Ought Never to be
deprived” of their arms, so long as they “Continue[d] honest and Lawfull
Subjects of Government.”  Ibid.  Even if the amendment contemplated
disarming dishonest and unlawful subjects, the Government makes no
effort to define those terms or explain why they necessarily include the
individuals  covered  by  §922(g)(8).    In  any  event,  evidence  concerning
what proponents behind an amendment to a single state constitution be-
lieved is too paltry to define the Second Amendment right.  See Bruen,
597 U. S., at 46.

These  proposals  carry  little  interpretative  weight.    To
begin with, it is “dubious to rely on [drafting] history to in-
terpret a text that was widely understood to codify a pre-
existing  right.”  Heller,  554  U. S.,  at  603.    Moreover,  the
States rejected the proposals.  Samuel Adams withdrew his
own proposal after it “alarmed both Federalists and Anti-
federalists.”  6 Documentary History 1453 (internal quota-
tion marks omitted).4  The Pennsylvania Anti-Federalists’
proposal similarly failed to gain a majority of the state con-
vention.  2 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary
History 628 (1971).

The Government never explains why or how language ex-
cluded from the Constitution could operate to limit the lan-
guage actually ratified.  The more natural inference seems
to be the opposite—the unsuccessful proposals suggest that
the Second Amendment preserves a more expansive right.
After  all,  the  Founders  considered,  and  rejected,  any  tex-
tual limitations in favor of an unqualified directive: “[T]he
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be in-
fringed.”

In addition to the proposals, the Government throws in a
hodgepodge of sources from the mid-to-late 1800s that use
the phrase “peaceable” in relation to firearms.  Many of the
sources simply make passing reference to the notion.  See,
e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, p. 229
(1866)  (proposed  circular  explaining  freed  slaves  “have
shown by their peaceful and orderly conduct that they can
safely be trusted with fire-arms, and they need them to kill
game for subsistence”).  Other sources are individual mus-
ings on firearms policy.  See, e.g., The Sale of Pistols, N. Y.
Times, June 22, 1874 (advocating for “including pistols in

the law against carrying concealed weapons”).  Sources that
do  discuss  disarmament  generally  describe  nonpeaceable
citizens  as  those  who  threaten  the  public  or  government.
For example, the Government quotes a Union General’s or-
der that “all loyal and peaceable citizens in Missouri will be
permitted to bear arms.”  Headquarters, Dept. of the Mis-
souri, General Orders, No. 86 (Aug. 25, 1863), in The War
of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the
Union and Confederate Armies, Ser. 1, Vol. 22, Pt. 2, p. 475
(1888).  Yet, the Government fails to mention that the Un-
ion General’s order addresses the “[l]arge numbers of men
. . .  leaving  the  broken  rebel  armies  . . .  and  returning  to
Missouri . . . with the purpose of following a career of plun-
der and murder.”  Id., at 474.  The order provided that “all
those  who  voluntarily  abandon[ed]  the  rebel  cause”  could
return  to  Missouri,  but  only  if  they  “surrender[ed]  them-
selves  and  their  arms,”  “[took]  the  oath  of  allegiance  and
[gave] bond for their future good conduct.”  Ibid.  By con-
trast,  “all  loyal  and  peaceable  citizens  in  Missouri  w[ere]
permitted  to  bear  arms”  to  “protect  themselves  from  vio-
lence”  and  “aid  the  troops.”    Id.,  at  475.  Thus,  the  term
“loyal and peaceable” distinguished between the former re-
bels residing in Missouri who were disarmed to prevent re-
bellion  and  those  citizens  who  would  help  fight  against
them.

The  Government’s  smorgasbord  of  commentary  proves
little of relevance, and it certainly does not establish a “his-
torical tradition that delimits the outer bounds of the right
to keep and bear arms.”  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 19.

iii

The  Government’s  remaining  evidence  is  even  further
afield.  The Government points to an assortment of firearm
regulations, covering everything from storage practices  to
treason and mental illness.  They are all irrelevant for pur-
poses  of  §922(g)(8).    Again,  the  “central  considerations”

14

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

when  comparing  modern  and  historical  regulations  are
whether they “impose a comparable burden” that is “com-
parably  justified.”  Id.,  at  29  (emphasis  deleted;  internal
quotation  marks  omitted).  The  Government’s  evidence
touches on one or none of these considerations.

The Government’s reliance on firearm storage laws is a
helpful example.  These laws penalized the improper stor-
age of firearms with forfeiture of those weapons.  See, e.g.,
Act of Mar. 1, 1783, ch. 46, 1782 Mass. Acts pp. 119–120.
First, these storage laws did not impose a “comparable bur-
den” to that of §922(g)(8).  Forfeiture still allows a person to
keep their other firearms or obtain additional ones.  It is in
no  way  equivalent  to  §922(g)(8)’s  complete  prohibition  on
owning or possessing any firearms.

In fact, the Court already reached a similar conclusion in
Heller.  The Court was tasked with comparing laws impos-
ing “a small fine and forfeiture of the weapon” with the Dis-
trict of Columbia’s ban on keeping functional handguns at
home  for  self-defense,  which  was  punishable  by  a  year  in
prison.  554 U. S., at 633–634.  We explained that the for-
feiture laws were “akin to modern penalties for minor pub-
lic-safety  infractions  like  speeding  or  jaywalking.”    Id.,  at
633.  Such  inconsequential  punishment  would  not  have
“prevented a person in the founding era from using a gun
to protect himself or his family.”  Id., at 634.  Accordingly,
we concluded that the burdens were not equivalent.  See id.,
at 633–634.  That analysis applies here in full force.  If a
small fine and forfeiture is not equivalent to the District of
Columbia’s  handgun  ban,  it  certainly  falls  short  of
§922(g)(8)’s ban on possessing any firearm.

The Government resists the conclusion that forfeiture is
less burdensome than a possession ban, arguing that “[t]he
burdens imposed by bans on keeping, bearing, and obtain-
ing arms are all comparable.”  Reply Brief 10.  But, there is
surely a distinction between having no Second Amendment
rights and having some Second Amendment rights.  If self-

THOMAS, J., dissenting

defense  is  “the  central  component  of  the  [Second  Amend-
ment]  right,”  then  common  sense  dictates  that  it  matters
whether you can defend yourself with a firearm anywhere,
only at home, or nowhere.  Heller, 554 U. S., at 599 (empha-
sis deleted).  And, the Government’s suggestion ignores that
we have repeatedly drawn careful distinctions between var-
ious  laws’  burdens.  See,  e.g.,  id.,  at  632  (explaining  that
laws  that  “did  not  clearly  prohibit  loaded  weapons  . . .  do
not remotely burden the right of self-defense as much as an
absolute ban on handguns”); see also Bruen, 597 U. S., at
48.

Our  careful  parsing  of  regulatory  burdens  makes  sense
given that  the Second  Amendment codifies a right  with  a
“historically fixed meaning.”  Id., at 28.  Accordingly, his-
tory is our reference point and anchor.  If we stray too far
from  it  by  eliding  material  differences  between  historical
and modern laws, we “risk endorsing outliers that our an-
cestors would never have accepted.”  Id., at 30 (internal quo-
tation marks and alteration omitted).

Second, the Government offers no “comparable justifica-
tion” between laws punishing firearm storage practices and
§922(g)(8).  It posits that both laws punish persons whose
“conduct suggested that he would not use [firearms] respon-
sibly.”  Brief for United States 24.  The Government, how-
ever, does not even attempt to ground that justification in
historical evidence.  See infra, at 28–29.

The  Government’s  proposed  justification  is  also  far  too
general.  Nearly all firearm regulations can be cast as pre-
venting  “irresponsible”  or  “unfit”  persons  from  accessing
firearms.  In addition, to argue that a law limiting access to
firearms is justified by the fact that the regulated groups
should  not  have  access  to  firearms  is  a  logical  merry-go-
round.  As  the  Court  has  made  clear,  such  overly  broad
judgments cannot suffice.  In Bruen, New York claimed it
could  effectively  ban  public  carry  because  “the  island  of
Manhattan [is] a ‘sensitive place.’ ”  597 U. S., at 31.  New

16

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

York defined a “sensitive place” as “all places where people
typically congregate and where law-enforcement and other
public-safety  professionals  are  presumptively  available.”
Id.,  at  30–31  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    The
Court  rejected  that  definition  as  “far  too  broa[d]”  as  it
“would in effect exempt cities from the Second Amendment
and  would  eviscerate  the  general  right  to  publicly  carry
arms for self-defense.”  Id., at 31.  Likewise, calling a mod-
ern  and  historical  law  comparably  justified  because  they
both prevent unfit persons from accessing firearms would
render our comparable-justification inquiry toothless.5

In sum, the Government has not identified any historical

regulation that is relevantly similar to §922(g)(8).

2

This  dearth  of  evidence  is  unsurprising  because  the
Founders  responded  to  the  societal  problem  of  interper-
sonal  violence  through  a  less  burdensome  regime:  surety
laws.  Tracing  back  to  early  English  history,  surety  laws
were  a  preventative  mechanism  for  ensuring  an  individ-
ual’s future peaceable conduct.  See D. Feldman, The King’s
Peace,  the  Royal  Prerogative  and  Public  Order,  47  Cam-
bridge L. J. 101, 101–102 (1988); M. Dalton, The Countrey
Justice  140–144  (1619).    If  someone  received  a  surety  de-
mand,  he  was  required  to  go  to  a  court  or  judicial  officer
——————

5 The Government’s other analogies suffer from the same flaws as the
firearm storage laws.  It cites laws restricting firearm sales to and public
carry  by  various  groups  such  as  minors  and  intoxicated  persons;  laws
confiscating firearms from rioters; and laws disarming insurrectionists
and rebels.  Brief for United States 22–27.  These laws target different
groups of citizens, for different reasons, and through different, less oner-
ous burdens than §922(g)(8).  See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 70 (explaining that
regulations  “limit[ing]  the  intent  for  which  one  could  carry  arms,  the
manner by which one carried arms, or the exceptional circumstances un-
der which one could not carry arms” do not justify “broadly prohibit[ing]
the public carry of commonly used firearms for personal defense”).  None
establishes that the particular regulation at issue here would have been
within the bounds of the pre-existing Second Amendment right.

with  one  or  more  members  of  the  community—i.e.,  sure-
ties—and comply with certain conditions.  4 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries  on  the  Laws  of  England  249–250  (1769)
(Blackstone).    Specifically,  the  person  providing  sureties
was required to “keep the peace: either generally . . . or . . .
with regard to the person who crave[d] the security” until a
set date.  Id., at 250.  If he kept the peace, the surety obli-
gation dissolved on that predetermined date.  See ibid.  If,
however, he breached the peace before that date, he and his
sureties would owe a set sum of money.  See id., at 249–250.
Evidence  suggests  that  sureties  were  readily  available.
Even  children,  who  “[we]re  incapable  of  engaging  them-
selves to answer any debt,” could still find “security by their
friends.”  Id., at 251.

There  is  little  question  that  surety  laws  applied  to  the
threat  of  future  interpersonal  violence.    “[W]herever  any
private man [had] just cause to fear, that another w[ould]
burn his house, or do him a corporal injury, by killing, im-
prisoning, or beating him . . . he [could] demand surety of
the  peace  against  such  person.”  Id.,  at  252;  see  also  J.
Backus,  The  Justice  of  the  Peace  25  (1816)  (providing  for
sureties when a person “stands in fear of his life, or of some
harm to be done to his person or his estate” (emphasis de-
leted)).

Surety demands were also expressly available to prevent
domestic  violence.  Surety  could  be  sought  by  “a  wife
against her husband who threatens to kill her or beat her
outrageously, or, if she have notorious cause to fear he will
do either.”  Id., at 24; see 1 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown
253 (6th ed. 1777) (“[I]t is certain, that a wife may demand
[a surety] against her husband threatening to beat her out-
rageously, and that a husband also may have it against his
wife”).  The right to demand sureties in cases of potential
domestic violence was recognized not only by treatises, but
also the founding-era courts.  Records from before and after
the  Second  Amendment’s  ratification  reflect  that  spouses

18

successfully demanded sureties when they feared future do-
mestic violence.  See, e.g., Records of the Courts of Quarter
Sessions and Common Pleas of Bucks County, Pennsylva-
nia,  1684–1700,  pp.  80–81  (1943)  (detailing  surety  de-
manded  upon  allegations  that  a  husband  was  “abusive  to
[his wife] that she was afraid of her Life & of her Childrns
lifes”); see also Heyn’s Case, 2 Ves. & Bea. 182, 35 Eng. Rep.
288 (Ch. 1813) (1822) (granting wife’s request to order her
husband  who  committed  “various  acts  of  ill  usage  and
threats”  to  “find  sufficient  sureties”);  Anonymous,  1
S. C. Eq. 113 (1785) (order requiring husband to “enter into
recognizance . . . with two sureties . . . for keeping the peace
towards the complainant (his wife)”).

3
Although surety laws shared a common justification with
§922(g)(8), surety laws imposed a materially different bur-
den.  Critically, a surety demand did not alter an individ-
ual’s right to keep and bear arms.  After providing sureties,
a person kept possession of all his firearms; could purchase
additional firearms; and could carry firearms in public and
private.  Even  if  he  breached  the  peace,  the  only  penalty
was that he and his sureties had to pay a sum of money.  4
Blackstone  250.  To  disarm  him,  the  Government  would
have to take some other action, such as imprisoning him for
a crime.  See Feldman, 47 Cambridge L. J., at 101.

By contrast, §922(g)(8) strips an individual of his Second
Amendment  right.    The  statute’s  breadth  cannot  be  over-
stated.  For one, §922(g) criminalizes nearly all conduct re-
lated  to  covered  firearms  and  ammunition.    Most  funda-
mentally,  possession  is  prohibited,  except  in  the  rarest  of
circumstances.  See, e.g., United States v. Rozier, 598 F. 3d
768, 771 (CA11 2010) (per curiam) (concluding that it was
“irrelevant” whether defendant “possessed the handgun for
purposes  of  self-defense  (in  his  home)”);  United  States  v.

Gant,  691  F. 2d  1159,  1162  (CA5  1982)  (affirming  convic-
tion of a business owner under §922(g) predecessor statute
for briefly possessing a firearm to ward off suspected rob-
bers).  Courts  of  Appeals  have  understood  “possession”
broadly, upholding convictions where a person “picked up
. . . three firearms for a few seconds to inspect” each, United
States v. Matthews, 520 F. 3d 806, 807 (CA7 2008), or “made
direct  contact  with  the  firearm  by  sitting  on  it,”  United
States v. Johnson, 46 F. 4th 1183, 1189 (CA10 2022).  They
have also construed §922(g) to bar “constructive possession”
of a firearm, including, for example, ammunition found in a
jointly occupied home.  See, e.g., United States v. Stepp, 89
F. 4th 826, 832–835 (CA10 2023).

Moreover,  §922(g)  captures  virtually  all  commercially
available firearms and ammunition.  It prohibits possessing
a  firearm  “in  or  affecting  commerce”  and  “receiv[ing]  any
firearm  or  ammunition  which  has  been  shipped  or  trans-
ported  in  interstate  or  foreign  commerce.”    §922(g).  As
courts have interpreted that nexus, if a firearm or ammu-
nition has at any point crossed interstate lines, it is regu-
lated  by  §922(g).  See  Scarborough  v.  United  States,  431
U. S.  563,  566–567  (1977)  (holding  §922(g)’s  predecessor
statute covered firearm that “had previously traveled in in-
terstate  commerce”);  United  States  v.  Lemons,  302  F. 3d
769,  772  (CA7  2002)  (affirming  conviction  under  §922(g)
for  possessing  firearm  that  “crossed  into  Wisconsin  after
its manufacture at some indeterminate moment in time—
possibly years before it was discovered in [the defendant’s]
possession”).6  In fact, the statute goes even further by reg-
ulating not only ammunition but also all constituent parts

Congress’s  power  under  the  Commerce  Clause.  See  United  States  v.

of ammunition—many of which are parts with no danger-
ous function on their own.  See 18 U. S. C. §921(a)(17)(A).

These sweeping prohibitions are criminally enforced.  To
violate the statute is a felony, punishable by up to 15 years.
§924(a)(8).  That felony conviction, in turn, triggers a per-
manent,  life-long  prohibition  on  exercising  the  Second
Amendment right.  See §922(g)(1).

The  combination  of  the  Government’s  sweeping  view  of
the  firearms  and  ammunition  within  its  regulatory  reach
and the broad prohibition on any conduct regarding covered
firearms  and  ammunition  makes  §922(g)(8)’s  burden  un-
mistakable: The statute revokes a citizen’s Second Amend-
ment right while the civil restraining order is in place.  And,
that  revocation  is  absolute.    It  makes  no  difference  if  the
covered  individual  agrees  to  a  no-contact  order,  posts  a
bond, or even moves across the country from his former do-
mestic partner—the bar on exercising the Second Amend-
ment right remains.  See United States v. Wilkey, 2020 WL
4464668, *1 (D Mont., Aug. 4, 2020) (defendant agreed to
Florida protection order so he could “ ‘just walk away’ ” and
was prosecuted several years later for possessing firearms
in Montana).

That combination of burdens places §922(g)(8) in an en-
tirely different stratum from surety laws.  Surety laws pre-
serve  the  Second  Amendment  right,  whereas  §922(g)(8)
strips an individual of that right.  While a breach of a surety
demand was punishable by a fine, §922(g)(8) is punishable
by a felony conviction, which in turn permanently revokes
an individual’s Second Amendment right.  At base, it is dif-
ficult  to  imagine  how  surety  laws  can  be  considered  rele-
vantly similar to a complete ban on firearm ownership, pos-
session, and use.

This observation is nothing new; the Court has already
recognized that surety laws impose a lesser relative burden
on the Second Amendment right.  In Bruen, the Court ex-

plained  that  surety  laws  merely  “provide  financial  incen-
tives for responsible arms carrying.”  597 U. S., at 59.  “[A]n
accused arms-bearer ‘could go on carrying without criminal
penalty’  so  long  as  he  ‘post[ed]  money  that  would  be  for-
feited if he breached the peace or injured others.’ ”  Id., at
56–57  (quoting  Wrenn  v.  District  of  Columbia,  864  F. 3d
650, 661 (CADC 2017); alteration in original).  As a result,
we held that surety laws were not analogous to New York’s
effective ban on public carry.  597 U. S., at 55.  That conclu-
sion  is  damning  for  §922(g)(8),  which  burdens  the  Second
Amendment right even more with respect to covered indi-
viduals.

Surety laws demonstrate that this case should have been
a  “straightforward”  inquiry.    Id.,  at  27.    The  Government
failed to produce a single historical regulation that is rele-
vantly similar to §922(g)(8).  Rather, §922(g)(8) addresses a
societal problem—the risk of interpersonal violence—“that
has  persisted  since  the  18th  century,”  yet  was  addressed
“through [the] materially different means” of  surety laws.
Id., at 26.

C

The  Court  has  two  rejoinders,  surety  and  affray  laws.
Neither is a compelling historical analogue.  As I have ex-
plained, surety laws did not impose a burden comparable to
§922(g)(8).  And, affray laws had a dissimilar burden and
justification.  The  Court  does  not  reckon  with  these  vital
differences,  asserting  that  the  disagreement  is  whether
surety and affray laws must be an exact copy of §922(g)(8).
Ante, at 16.  But, the historical evidence shows that those
laws are worlds—not degrees—apart from §922(g)(8).  For
this  reason,  the  Court’s  argument  requires  combining  as-
pects of surety and affray laws to justify §922(g)(8).  This
piecemeal approach is not what the Second Amendment or
our precedents countenance.

22

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

1
Despite  the  foregoing  evidence,  the  Court  insists  that
surety laws in fact support §922(g)(8).  To make its case, the
Court  studiously  avoids  discussing  the  full  extent  of
§922(g)(8)’s burden as compared to surety laws.  The most
the Court does is attack Bruen’s conclusion that surety laws
were less burdensome than a public carry ban.  The Court
reasons that Bruen dealt with a “broad prohibitory regime”
while §922(g)(8) applies to only a subset of citizens.  Ante,
at 15–16.  Yet, that was only one way in which Bruen dis-
tinguished  a  public  carry  ban  from  surety  laws’  burden.
True, Bruen noted that, unlike the public carry ban, surety
laws did not restrict the general citizenry.  But, Bruen also
plainly held that surety laws did not “constitut[e] a ‘severe’
restraint on public carry, let alone a restriction tantamount
to a ban.”  597 U. S., at 59.  In fact, that conclusion is re-
peated throughout the opinion.  Id., at 55–59 (surety laws
“were not bans on public carry”; “surety laws did not pro-
hibit  public  carry”;  surety  laws  “were  not  viewed  as  sub-
stantial restrictions on public carry”; and “surety statutes
did not directly restrict public carry”).  Bruen’s conclusion
is  inescapable  and  correct.  Because  surety  laws  are  not
equivalent to an effective ban on public carry, they do not
impose a burden equivalent to a complete ban on carrying
and possessing firearms.

Next, the Court relies on affray laws prohibiting “riding
or  going  armed,  with  dangerous  or  unusual  weapons,  [to]
terrif[y] the good people of the land.”  4 Blackstone 149 (em-
phasis deleted).  These laws do not justify §922(g)(8) either.
As the Court concedes, why and how a historical regulation
burdened the right of armed self-defense are central consid-
erations.  Ante, at 7.  Affray laws are not a fit on either ba-
sis.

First,  affray  laws  had  a  distinct  justification  from
§922(g)(8) because they regulated only certain public con-
duct that injured the entire community.  An affray was a

“common  Nusanc[e],”  1  Hawkins,  Pleas  of  the  Crown,  at
135, defined as “the fighting of two or more persons in some
public place, to the terror of his majesty’s subjects,” 4 Black-
stone 145.  Even though an affray generally required “ac-
tual  violence,”  certain  other  conduct  could  suffice.  1  R.
Burn, The Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer 13 (2d
ed. 1756).  As relevant here, an affray included arming one-
self “with dangerous and unusual weapons, in such a man-
ner as [to] naturally cause a terror to the people”—i.e., “go-
ing  armed.”  Ibid.  Many  postfounding  going  armed  laws
had a self-defense exception: A person could “go armed with
a[n] . . . offensive and dangerous weapon” so long as he had
“reasonable cause to fear an assault or other injury.”  Mass.
Rev. Stat., ch. 134, §16 (1836); see also 1838 Terr. of Wis.
Stat.  §16,  p.  381;  1851  Terr.  of  Minn.  Rev.  Stat.,  ch.  112,
§18.

Affrays  were  defined  by  their  public  nature  and  effect.
An affray could occur only in “some public place,” and cap-
tured  only  conduct  affecting  the  broader  public.    4  Black-
stone 145.  To that end, going armed laws did not prohibit
carrying firearms at home or even public carry generally.
See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 47–50.  Instead, they targeted only
public  carry  that  was  “accompanied  with  such  circum-
stances as are apt to terrify the people.”  1 Burn, Justice of
the Peace, at 13; see Bruen, 597 U. S., at 50 (explaining that
going  armed  laws  “prohibit  bearing  arms  in  a  way  that
spreads ‘fear’ or ‘terror’ among the people”).

Affrays  were  intentionally  distinguished  from  assaults
and private interpersonal violence on that same basis.  See
Cash  v.  State,  2  Tenn.  198,  199  (1813)  (“It  is  because  the
violence is committed in a public place, and to the terror of
the people, that the crime is called an affray, instead of as-
sault and battery”); Nottingham v. State, 227 Md. App. 592,
602, 135 A. 3d 541, 547 (Md. 2016) (“[U]nlike assault and
battery,” affray is “not a crime against the person; rather,
affray  is  a  crime  against  the  public”  (internal  quotation

24

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

marks omitted)).  As treatises shortly before the founding
explain, “there may be an Assault which will not amount to
an Affray; as where it happens in a private Place, out of the
hearing or seeing of any, except the Parties concerned; in
which Case it cannot be said to be to the Terror of the Peo-
ple.”  1 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, at 134; see 1 Burn,
Justice of the Peace, at 13.  Affrays thus did not cover the
very conduct §922(g)(8) seeks to prevent—interpersonal vi-
olence in the home.

Second, affray laws did not impose a burden analogous to
§922(g)(8).  They  regulated  a  niche  subset  of  Second
Amendment-protected  activity.    As  explained,  affray  laws
prohibited only carrying certain weapons (“dangerous and
unusual”) in a particular manner (“terrifying the good peo-
ple of the land” without a need for self-defense) and in par-
ticular places (in public).  Meanwhile, §922(g)(8) prevents a
covered person from carrying any firearm or ammunition,
in any manner, in any place, at any time, and for any rea-
son.  Section  922(g)(8)  thus  bans  all  Second  Amendment-
protected  activity.    Indeed,  this  Court  has  already  con-
cluded that affray laws do not impose a burden “analogous
to the burden created by” an effective ban on public carry.
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 50.  Surely, then, a law that imposes a
public and private ban on a covered individual cannot have
an analogous burden either.

The Court counters that since affray laws “provided for
imprisonment,”  they
lesser  burden  than
imposed  a
§922(g)(8)’s disarmament.  Ante, at 14.  But, that argument
serves  only  to  highlight  another  fundamental  difference:
Affray laws were criminal statutes that penalized past be-
havior, whereas §922(g)(8) is triggered by a civil restraining
order that seeks to prevent future behavior.  Accordingly,
an  affray’s  burden  was  vastly  harder  to  impose.    To  im-
prison a person, a State had to prove that he committed the
crime of affray beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Constitu-

Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)

25

THOMAS, J., dissenting

tion provided a bevy of protections during that process—in-
cluding  a  right  to  a  jury  trial,  counsel,  and  protections
against double jeopardy.  See Amdts. 5, 6.

The  imposition  of  §922(g)(8)’s  burden,  however,  has  far
fewer  hurdles  to  clear.    There  is  no  requirement  that  the
accused has actually committed a crime; instead, he need
only be prohibited from threatening or using force, or pose
a  “credible  threat”  to  an  “intimate  partner  or  child.”
§922(g)(8)(C).  Section  922(g)(8)  thus  revokes  a  person’s
Second  Amendment  right  based  on  the  suspicion  that  he
may  commit  a  crime  in  the  future.    In  addition,  the  only
process required before that revocation is a hearing on the
underlying  court  order.   §922(g)(8)(A).  During  that  civil
hearing—which is not even about §922(g)(8)—a person has
fewer  constitutional  protections  compared  to  a  criminal
prosecution  for  affray.  Gone  are  the  Sixth  Amendment’s
panoply of rights, including the rights to confront witnesses
and have assistance of counsel, as well as the Fifth Amend-
ment’s  protection  against  double  jeopardy.    See  Turner  v.
Rogers, 564 U. S. 431, 441 (2011) (“[T]he Sixth Amendment
does not govern civil cases”); Hudson v. United States, 522
U. S. 93, 99 (1997) (“The [Double Jeopardy] Clause protects
only  against  the  imposition  of  multiple  criminal  punish-
ments for the same offense”).  Civil proceedings also do not
require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and some States
even set aside the rules of evidence, allowing parties to rely
on  hearsay.  See,  e.g.,  Wash.  Rule  Evid.  1101(c)(4)  (2024)
(providing the state rules of evidence “need not be applied”
to applications for protection orders (boldface and capitali-
zation deleted)); Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. §527.6(i) (West
Supp. 2024) (judge “shall receive any testimony that is rel-
evant” and issue order based on clear and convincing evi-
dence).  The differences between criminal prosecutions and
civil hearings are numerous and consequential.

Affray  laws  are  wide  of  the  mark.    While  the  Second
Amendment does not demand a historical twin, it requires

26

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

something  closer  than  affray  laws,  which  expressly  carve
out the very conduct §922(g)(8) was designed to prevent (in-
terpersonal  violence  in  the  home).    Nor  would  I  conclude
that affray  laws—criminal laws regulating a  specific type
of public carry—are analogous to §922(g)(8)’s use of a civil
proceeding  to  bar  all  Second  Amendment-protected  activ-
ity.

2
The Court recognizes that surety and affray laws on their
own are not enough.  So it takes pieces from each to stitch
together an analogue for §922(g)(8).  Ante, at 13.  Our prec-
edents foreclose that approach.  The question before us is
whether a single historical law has both a comparable bur-
den  and  justification  as  §922(g)(8),  not  whether  several
laws  can  be  cobbled  together  to  qualify.    As  Bruen  ex-
plained, “determining whether a historical regulation is a
proper analogue for a distinctly modern firearm regulation
requires a determination of whether the two regulations”—
the  historical  and  modern  regulations—“are  ‘relevantly
similar.’ ”    597  U. S.,  at  28–29.    In  doing  so,  a  court  must
consider  whether
that  single  historical  regulation
“impose[s] a comparable burden on the right of armed self-
defense and whether that burden is comparably justified.”
Id., at 29 (emphasis added).

The  Court’s  contrary  approach  of  mixing  and  matching
historical  laws—relying  on  one  law’s  burden  and  another
law’s  justification—defeats  the  purpose  of  a  historical  in-
quiry altogether.  Given that imprisonment (which involved
disarmament) existed at the founding, the Government can
always  satisfy  this  newly  minted  comparable-burden  re-
quirement.  See  ante,  at  14–15.  That  means  the  Govern-
ment need only find a historical law with a comparable jus-
tification  to  validate  modern  disarmament  regimes.  As  a
result, historical laws fining certain behavior could justify
completely disarming a person for the same behavior.  That

27

THOMAS, J., dissenting

is  the  exact  sort  of  “regulatory  blank  check”  that  Bruen
warns against and the American people ratified the Second
Amendment to preclude.  597 U. S., at 30.

Neither the Court nor the Government identifies a single
historical regulation with a comparable burden and justifi-
cation  as  §922(g)(8).  Because  there  is  none,  I  would  con-
clude  that  the  statute  is  inconsistent  with  the  Second
Amendment.

IV

The Government, for its part, tries to rewrite the Second
Amendment to salvage its case.  It argues that the Second
Amendment allows Congress to disarm anyone who is not
“responsible”  and  “law-abiding.”  Not  a  single  Member  of
the  Court  adopts  the  Government’s  theory.  Indeed,  the
Court  disposes  of  it  in  half  a  page—and  for  good  reason.
Ante, at 17.  The Government’s argument lacks any basis in
our  precedents  and  would  eviscerate  the  Second  Amend-
ment altogether.

A

The Government’s position is a bald attempt to refashion
this Court’s doctrine.  At the outset of this case, the Govern-
ment contended that the Court has already held the Second
Amendment  protects  only  “responsible,  law-abiding”  citi-
zens.  Brief for United States 6, 11–12.  The plain text of
the  Second  Amendment  quashes  this  argument.  The
Amendment recognizes “the right of the people to keep and
bear Arms.”  (Emphasis added.)  When the Constitution re-
fers to “the people,” the term “unambiguously refers to all
members of the political community.”  Heller, 554 U. S., at
580;  see  also  id.,  at  581  (beginning  its  analysis  with  the
strong “presumption that the Second Amendment right . . .
belongs  to  all  Americans”).  The  Government’s  claim  that
the  Court  already  held  the  Second  Amendment  protects

28

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

only “law-abiding, responsible citizens” is specious at best.7
See ante, at 17.

At argument, the Government invented yet another posi-
tion.  It explained that when it used the term “responsible”
in its briefs, it really meant “not dangerous.”  See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 10–11.  Thus, it posited that the Second Amendment
protects only law-abiding and non-dangerous citizens.  No
matter  how  many  adjectives  the  Government  swaps  out,
the fact remains that the Court has never adopted anything
akin to the Government’s test.  In reality, the “law-abiding,
dangerous citizen” test is the Government’s own creation,
designed to justify every one of its existing regulations.  It
has no doctrinal or constitutional mooring.

The Government finally tries to cram its dangerousness
test into our precedents.  It argues that §922(g)(8) and its
proffered historical laws have a shared justification of dis-
arming  dangerous  citizens.  The  Government,  however,
does not draw that conclusion by examining the historical
justification  for  each  law  cited.    Instead,  the  Government
simply looks—from a modern vantage point—at the mix of
laws and manufactures a possible connection between them
all.  Yet,  our  task  is  to  “assess  whether  modern  firearms
regulations  are  consistent  with  the  Second  Amendment’s
text and historical understanding.”  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 26
(emphasis added).  To do so, we must look at the historical
law’s  justification  as  articulated  during  the  relevant  time
period—not at modern post-hoc speculations.  See, e.g., id.,
at 41–42, 48–49; Heller, 554 U. S., at 631–632.  As I have
explained, a historically based study of the evidence reveals
that the Government’s position is untenable.  Supra, at 7–

——————

7 The only conceivably relevant language in our precedents is the pass-
ing reference in Heller to laws banning felons and others from possessing
firearms.  See 554 U. S., at 626–627, and n. 26.  That discussion is dicta.
As for Bruen, the Court used the phrase “ordinary, law-abiding citizens”
merely to describe those who were unable to publicly carry a firearm in
New York.  See, e.g., 597 U. S., at 9, 15, 31–32, 71.

13.

As it does today, the Court should continue to rebuff the
Government’s attempts to rewrite the Second Amendment
and the Court’s precedents interpreting it.

B
The Government’s “law-abiding, dangerous citizen” the-
ory is also antithetical to our constitutional structure.  At
bottom, its test stems from the idea that the Second Amend-
ment  points  to  general  principles,  not  a  historically
grounded  right.  And,  it  asserts  that  one  of  those  general
principles  is  that  Congress  can  disarm  anyone  it  deems
“dangerous,  irresponsible,  or  otherwise  unfit  to  possess
arms.”  Brief for United States 7.  This approach is wrong
as a matter of constitutional interpretation, and it under-
mines the very purpose and function of the Second Amend-
ment.

The  Second  Amendment  recognizes  a  pre-existing  right
and that right was “enshrined with the scope” it was “un-
derstood  to  have  when  the  people  adopted  [the  Amend-
ment].”  Heller, 554 U. S., at 634–635.  Only a subsequent
constitutional  amendment  can  alter  the  Second  Amend-
ment’s  terms,  “whether  or  not  future  legislatures  or  . . .
even future judges think [its original] scope [is] too broad.”
Id., at 635.

Yet,  the  Government’s  “law-abiding,  dangerous  citizen”
test—and  indeed  any  similar,  principle-based  approach—
would hollow out the Second Amendment of any substance.
Congress could impose any firearm regulation so long as it
targets “unfit” persons.  And, of course, Congress would also
dictate  what  “unfit”  means  and  who  qualifies.    See  Tr.  of
Oral Arg. 7, 51.  The historical understanding of the Second
Amendment right would be irrelevant.  In fact, the Govern-
ment  posits  that  Congress  could  enact  a  law  that  the
Founders explicitly rejected.  See id., at 18 (agreeing that

30

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

modern judgment would override “[f]ounding-[e]ra applica-
tions”).  At base, whether a person could keep, bear, or even
possess  firearms  would  be  Congress’s  policy  choice  under
the Government’s test.

That would be the direct inverse of the Founders’ and rat-
ifying public’s intent.  Instead of a substantive right guar-
anteed to every individual against Congress, we would have
a right controlled by Congress.  “A constitutional guarantee
subject to future judges’ [or Congresses’] assessments of its
usefulness  is  no  constitutional  guarantee  at  all.”    Heller,
554  U. S.,  at  634.  The  Second  Amendment  is  “the  very
product of an interest balancing by the people.”  Id., at 635.
It is this policy judgment—not that of modern and future
Congresses—“that  demands  our  unqualified  deference.”
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 26.

The Government’s own evidence exemplifies the dangers
of approaches based on generalized principles.  Before the
Court of Appeals, the Government pointed to colonial stat-
utes “disarming classes of people deemed to be threats, in-
cluding . . . slaves, and native Americans.”  Supp. Brief for
United States in No. 21–11001 (CA5), p. 33.  It argued that
since  early  legislatures  disarmed  groups  considered  to  be
“threats,” a modern Congress has the same authority.  Ibid.
The problem with such a view should be obvious.  Far from
an exemplar of Congress’s authority, the discriminatory re-
gimes  the  Government  relied  upon  are  cautionary  tales.
They warn that when majoritarian interests alone dictate
who is “dangerous,” and thus can be disarmed, disfavored
groups become easy prey.  One of many such examples was
the  treatment  of  freed  blacks  following  the  Civil  War.
“[M]any of the over 180,000 African-Americans who served
in the Union Army returned to the States of the old Confed-
eracy, where systematic efforts were made to disarm them
and other blacks.”  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 771
formally  prohibited  African-
(2010).
  And,
Americans  from  possessing  firearms.”

Some  “States

  Ibid.

THOMAS, J., dissenting

“[t]hroughout  the  South,  armed  parties  . . .  forcibly  took
firearms  from  newly  freed  slaves.”  Id.,  at  772.  “In  one
town, the marshal took all arms from returned colored sol-
diers, and was very prompt in shooting the blacks whenever
an  opportunity  occurred.”    Ibid.  (alterations  and  internal
quotation  marks  omitted).    A  constitutional  amendment
was ultimately “necessary to provide full protection for the
rights of blacks.”  Id., at 775.

The Government peddles a modern version of the govern-
mental authority that led to those historical evils.  Its the-
ory would allow federal majoritarian interests to determine
who  can  and  cannot  exercise  their  constitutional  rights.
While Congress cannot revive disarmament laws based on
race, one can easily imagine a world where political minor-
ities or those with disfavored cultural views are deemed the
next “dangers” to society.  Thankfully, the Constitution pro-
hibits  such  laws.  The  “very  enumeration  of  the  [Second
Amendment] right takes out of the hands of government . . .
the  power  to  decide  on  a  case-by-case  basis  whether  the
right is really worth insisting upon.”  Heller, 544 U. S., at
634.

The Court rightly rejects the Government’s approach by
concluding that any modern regulation must be justified by
specific historical regulations.  See ante, at 10–15.  But, the
Court should remain wary of any theory in the future that
would exchange the Second Amendment’s boundary line—
“the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed”—for  vague  (and  dubious)  principles  with  con-
tours defined by whoever happens to be in power.

This case is not about whether States can disarm people
who threaten others.  States have a ready mechanism for
disarming anyone who uses a firearm to threaten physical
violence:  criminal  prosecution.  Most  States,  including
Texas, classify aggravated assault as a felony, punishable

32

UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

THOMAS, J., dissenting

by up to 20 years’ imprisonment.  See Tex. Penal Code Ann.
§§22.02(b), 12.33 (West 2019 and Supp. 2023).  Assuming
C. M.’s allegations could be proved, Texas could have con-
victed and imprisoned Rahimi for every one of his alleged
acts.  Thus, the question before us is not whether Rahimi
and  others  like  him  can  be  disarmed  consistent  with  the
Second Amendment.  Instead, the question is whether the
Government can strip the Second Amendment right of any-
one subject to a protective order—even if he has never been
accused or convicted of a crime.  It cannot.  The Court and
Government do not point to a single historical law revoking
a citizen’s Second Amendment  right based on possible in-
terpersonal  violence.  The  Government  has  not  borne  its
burden to prove that §922(g)(8) is consistent with the Sec-
ond Amendment’s text and historical understanding.

The  Framers  and  ratifying  public  understood  “that  the
right to keep and bear arms was essential to the preserva-
tion of liberty.”  McDonald, 561 U. S., at 858 (THOMAS, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Yet, in the
interest of ensuring the Government can regulate one sub-
set  of  society,  today’s  decision  puts  at  risk  the  Second
Amendment rights of many more.  I respectfully dissent.
