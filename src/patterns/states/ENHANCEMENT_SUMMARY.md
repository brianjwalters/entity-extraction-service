## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priority**: Enhance remaining high-volume states (New York needs completion, New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina)
2. **Testing Protocol**: Validate all patterns against test corpus in `/tests/docs/`
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure extraction speed and accuracy metrics
4. **Documentation**: Create state-specific pattern documentation for legal teams
5. **Maintenance Schedule**: Quarterly review of patterns for legal updates
