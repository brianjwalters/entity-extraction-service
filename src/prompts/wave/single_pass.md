## Critical Schema Requirements

1. **Entity Type Field**: Use only `entity_type` (NOT `type`)
2. **Position Fields**: Use `start_pos` and `end_pos` (NOT `start_position` or `end_position`)
3. **Confidence Range**: Must be between 0.0 and 1.0
4. **Unique IDs**: Generate unique ID for each entity
5. **Metadata Structure**: Follow the nested metadata format exactly
6. **Required Fields**: All entities must have: `text`, `entity_type`, `start_pos`, `end_pos`, `confidence`, `extraction_method`

## Quality Standards

- **High Confidence (0.8-1.0)**: Clear pattern matches with strong context - REQUIRED for this pass
- **Medium Confidence (0.5-0.8)**: Partial pattern matches or uncertain context - AVOID
- **Minimum Threshold**: Do not extract entities below 0.80 confidence

## Special Instructions

1. **Exact Text**: Preserve exact text as it appears, including punctuation
2. **Position Accuracy**: Ensure start_pos and end_pos are accurate character positions
3. **No Overlaps**: Avoid overlapping entity boundaries
4. **Sentence Context**: Include surrounding sentence in metadata
5. **Normalization**: Provide standardized forms:
   - Blue Book format for case citations
   - ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) for dates
   - Normalized statute citations (18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8))
6. **Component Parsing**: Break down complex entities:
   - Case citations: case_name, volume, reporter, page, year
   - Dates: year, month, day in parsed_date field
   - Statutes: title, code, section, subsection

## Validation Checks

- Verify all entities meet confidence threshold (≥0.80)
- Ensure no duplicate text extractions
- Validate position boundaries don't exceed text length
- Confirm entity_type matches allowed types (15 types only)
- Check that confidence scores are in valid range [0.0, 1.0]
- Validate component parsing accuracy for citations and dates
- Verify Bluebook format compliance for case citations

## Performance Optimization

Since this is a single-pass extraction for small documents:
- Prioritize HIGH-CONFIDENCE entities (0.80+)
- Focus on the 15 critical entity types listed above
- Skip low-confidence extractions (better to miss than false positives)
- Ensure output is valid JSON format
- Complete extraction in single LLM call

Extract ALL qualifying entities meeting the confidence threshold. This single pass covers the most critical legal entities for small document analysis (2-5 pages typically).
