## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Wave 2 Error Prevention Rules

### üö´ ERROR #1: Statute vs Procedural Rule Confusion (CRITICAL FOR WAVE 2)
**¬ß922(g)(8) is a USC STATUTE, NOT a PROCEDURAL RULE:**
- ‚ùå BAD: Extracting "18 U.S.C. ¬ß 922(g)(8)" as PROCEDURAL_RULE
- ‚úÖ GOOD: This was already extracted in Wave 1 as USC_CITATION
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Only extract "Fed. R. Civ. P. 56", "Rule 12(b)(6)", "FRCP 26", "FRE 403"

**Disambiguation Rule**:
- If it has "U.S.C.", state code, or statute number ‚Üí It's a STATUTE (Wave 1), NOT PROCEDURAL_RULE
- If it has "Fed. R.", "Rule", "FRCP", "FRE", "FRCR", "Local Rule" ‚Üí It's PROCEDURAL_RULE (Wave 2)

### üö´ ERROR #2: Case Name vs Case Number Confusion
**"Bruen" is a case NAME (CASE_CITATION from Wave 1), not a CASE_NUMBER:**
- ‚ùå BAD: Extracting "Bruen" as CASE_NUMBER or DOCKET_NUMBER
- ‚ùå BAD: Extracting case names like "Brown", "Roe", "Miranda" as numbers
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Only extract "No. 22-6640", "Case No. 1:20-cv-12345" format for case identifiers
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Extract "Docket Entry No. 45", "ECF No. 89" as DOCKET_NUMBER

**Validation**: CASE_NUMBER must have "No.", "Case No.", or numeric docket format. DOCKET_NUMBER must reference docket entries or ECF filings.

### üö´ ERROR #3: Don't Re-Extract Wave 1 Entities
**These were already extracted in Wave 1 - DO NOT extract again:**
- Case citations, statute citations, parties, attorneys
- Courts, judges, government entities, federal agencies
- Dates, filing dates, deadlines, hearing dates
- USC citations, CFR citations, constitutional citations

**Cross-Wave Validation**: Check previous_results to avoid duplicates. Wave 2 focuses on procedural ACTIONS, financial VALUES, and legal ORGANIZATIONS.

### üö´ ERROR #4: Generic Terms as Entity Types
**Don't extract generic procedural language without specific procedural context:**
- ‚ùå BAD: Extracting "the court granted" as MOTION (missing motion type)
- ‚ùå BAD: Extracting "discovery" as DISCOVERY without specific discovery context
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Extract "Motion for Summary Judgment" as MOTION
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Extract "Defendant's Request for Production of Documents" as PRODUCTION_REQUEST
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Extract "written discovery" or "Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories" as specific discovery types

**Validation**: Procedural entities should have clear procedural context and specific types.

### üö´ ERROR #5: Monetary Amount vs. Specific Financial Type Confusion
**Use specific financial entity types when available:**
- ‚ùå BAD: Extracting "damages of $1,000,000" as MONETARY_AMOUNT only
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Extract "damages of $1,000,000" as DAMAGES (with amount in metadata)
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Extract "attorney fees of $50,000" as ATTORNEY_FEES (not generic MONETARY_AMOUNT)
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Extract "bail set at $100,000" as BAIL (not MONETARY_AMOUNT)

**Disambiguation Rule**:
- If amount is damages ‚Üí Use DAMAGES
- If amount is bail ‚Üí Use BAIL
- If amount is attorney fees ‚Üí Use ATTORNEY_FEES
- If amount is fine/penalty ‚Üí Use FINE
- If amount is settlement ‚Üí Use SETTLEMENT
- If amount is restitution ‚Üí Use RESTITUTION
- If amount is contract value ‚Üí Use CONTRACT_VALUE
- If amount is generic/unspecified ‚Üí Use MONETARY_AMOUNT

## Critical Schema Requirements

1. **Entity Type Field**: Use only `entity_type` (NOT `type`)
2. **Position Fields**: Use `start_pos` and `end_pos` (NOT `start_position` or `end_position`)
3. **Confidence Range**: Must be between 0.0 and 1.0
4. **Unique IDs**: Generate unique ID for each entity
5. **Metadata Structure**: Follow the nested metadata format exactly
6. **Required Fields**: All entities must have: `text`, `entity_type`, `start_pos`, `end_pos`, `confidence`, `extraction_method`

## Quality Standards

- **High Confidence (0.8-1.0)**: Clear pattern matches with strong context
- **Medium Confidence (0.5-0.8)**: Partial pattern matches or uncertain context
- **Low Confidence (0.3-0.5)**: Weak pattern matches, use sparingly
- **Category-Specific Thresholds**:
  - Procedural Elements: ‚â•0.80 confidence
  - Financial Entities: ‚â•0.85 confidence
  - Judgment Entities: ‚â•0.85 confidence
  - Organizational Entities: ‚â•0.85 confidence

## Special Instructions

1. **Exact Text**: Preserve exact text as it appears, including punctuation
2. **Position Accuracy**: Ensure start_pos and end_pos are accurate character positions
3. **No Overlaps**: Avoid overlapping entity boundaries AND overlaps with Wave 1 entities
4. **Sentence Context**: Include surrounding sentence in metadata for validation
5. **Pattern Attribution**: When possible, attribute extraction to specific pattern sources
6. **Normalization**: Provide standardized forms:
   - Normalized monetary amounts ($1,000,000.00)
   - Canonical rule citations (Fed. R. Civ. P. 56)
   - Standardized motion types (summary_judgment, dismiss)
7. **Related Entities**: Link related entities using IDs when applicable
8. **Component Parsing**: Break down complex entities into components (see examples above)
9. **Category Assignment**: Assign appropriate category (procedural, financial, judgment, organizational)
10. **Subtype Specificity**: Use specific subtypes to enhance entity classification

## Validation Checks

- Verify all entities meet category-specific confidence thresholds
- Ensure no duplicate text extractions
- Validate position boundaries don't exceed text length
- Confirm entity_type matches allowed types for this wave
- Check that confidence scores are in valid range [0.0, 1.0]
- Verify no overlaps with Wave 1 entities (check previous_results)
- Validate component parsing accuracy
- Ensure financial entities have amount information in metadata
- Check procedural entities have type/subtype classification

## Wave 2 Focus

Extract ALL qualifying entities meeting the category-specific confidence thresholds. This is Wave 2 of 4 - focus on:

1. **Procedural Actions**: Motions, appeals, discovery requests, pleas
2. **Financial Information**: Monetary amounts, damages, bail, settlements, fees
3. **Judgment & Relief**: Court judgments, injunctions, protective orders, sentencing
4. **Legal Organizations**: Law firms, international firms, public interest organizations

**Wave 1** extracted: Case citations, statute citations, parties, attorneys, courts, judges, legal citations, temporal information, and government entities.

**Wave 2** (current) extracts: Procedural actions, financial values, judgments, relief, and legal organizations.

**Wave 3** will extract: Addresses, locations, contact information, corporate entities, and structural elements.

**Wave 4** will extract: Legal concepts, doctrines, constitutional provisions, and relationships.

Complete Wave 2 extraction now with MEDIUM-HIGH CONFIDENCE entities only.
