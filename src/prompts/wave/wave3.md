## Pattern Examples

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Wave 3 Error Prevention Rules

### üö´ ERROR #1: Cross-Wave Duplication Prevention
**DO NOT re-extract entities from Waves 1-2:**
- ‚ùå BAD: Re-extracting case citations, parties, attorneys from previous waves
- ‚ùå BAD: Re-extracting courts, judges, statute citations
- ‚ùå BAD: Re-extracting case numbers, motions, briefs, procedural rules
- ‚ùå BAD: Re-extracting CORPORATION (Wave 1), FEDERAL_AGENCY (Wave 1), LAW_FIRM (Wave 2)
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Only extract NEW entities: ADDRESS, EMAIL, PHONE_NUMBER, JURISDICTION, VENUE
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Extract constitutional entities, legal doctrines, structural elements

**Validation**: Check previous_results for position overlaps before extracting

### üö´ ERROR #2: Relationship Evidence Required
**ALL relationships MUST have explicit text evidence:**
- ‚ùå BAD: Creating REPRESENTS relationship without evidence text
- ‚ùå BAD: Inferring CITES relationship without citation language
- ‚ùå BAD: Guessing relationships from document structure alone
- ‚úÖ GOOD: "John Smith, Esq., represents the plaintiff" ‚Üí REPRESENTS relationship with evidence
- ‚úÖ GOOD: "As held in Brown v. Board" ‚Üí CITES relationship with evidence

**Validation**: evidence_text field MUST be populated and reference actual document text

### üö´ ERROR #3: Historical Legal Scholars (Wave 3 Cleanup)
**If Wave 1-2 missed these, DON'T extract as ATTORNEY or create REPRESENTS relationships:**
- ‚ùå BAD: "Blackstone" in "Blackstone's Commentaries" ‚Üí NOT an attorney
- ‚ùå BAD: Historical figures: "Coke", "Prosser", "Holmes" in treatise context
- ‚ùå BAD: Creating REPRESENTS relationship for historical legal scholars
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Only modern attorneys with explicit representation language
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Extract "Blackstone's Commentaries" as HISTORICAL (Wave 3)

**Validation**: Check context - is this a legal reference book or treatise citation?

### üö´ ERROR #4: Relationship Entity Validation
**Both source and target entities MUST exist before creating relationship:**
- ‚ùå BAD: Creating REPRESENTS relationship when attorney entity doesn't exist
- ‚ùå BAD: Creating CITES relationship when case citation wasn't extracted
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Verify source_entity_id exists in Waves 1-3 entities
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Verify target_entity_id exists in Waves 1-3 entities

**Validation**: Cross-reference entity IDs from previous_results before creating relationship

### üö´ ERROR #5: Corporate vs Party Disambiguation
**CORPORATION already extracted in Wave 1 - do NOT re-extract:**
- ‚ùå BAD: Extracting "Microsoft Corporation" as CORPORATION in Wave 3
- ‚úÖ GOOD: CORPORATION was extracted in Wave 1 as a party type
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Check Wave 1 PARTY and CORPORATION entities before extracting

**Validation**: Check Wave 1 CORPORATION entities to avoid duplication

### üö´ ERROR #6: Overly Broad Relationship Extraction
**Only extract relationships with explicit evidence, not implied:**
- ‚ùå BAD: Assuming PRESIDES_OVER because judge and court appear in same paragraph
- ‚ùå BAD: Inferring EMPLOYS from attorney name near law firm name
- ‚ùå BAD: Guessing JURISDICTION_OVER without explicit jurisdictional language
- ‚úÖ GOOD: "Judge Smith presides over this case" ‚Üí explicit PRESIDES_OVER
- ‚úÖ GOOD: "Attorney Jane Doe of Sullivan & Cromwell" ‚Üí explicit EMPLOYS

**Validation**: Require explicit verbs or prepositions linking entities

## Critical Schema Requirements

1. **Entity Type Field**: Use only `entity_type` (NOT `type`)
2. **Position Fields**: Use `start_pos` and `end_pos` (NOT `start_position` or `end_position`)
3. **Confidence Range**: Must be between 0.0 and 1.0
4. **Unique IDs**: Generate unique ID for each entity
5. **Metadata Structure**: Follow the nested metadata format exactly
6. **Required Fields**: All entities must have: `text`, `entity_type`, `start_pos`, `end_pos`, `confidence`, `extraction_method`

## Quality Standards

- **High Confidence (0.85-0.95)**: Constitutional entities, legal doctrines with clear pattern matches
- **Medium-High Confidence (0.80-0.90)**: Contact information, jurisdiction, venue with strong context
- **Medium Confidence (0.75-0.85)**: Structural elements, document markers with moderate context
- **Low-Medium Confidence (0.70-0.75)**: Enhanced patterns, meta-categories
- **Minimum Threshold**: Do not extract below 0.70 confidence for this wave

**Confidence Guidelines by Category:**
- Contact & Location Information: 0.80-0.90
- Constitutional Entities: 0.85-0.95
- Legal Doctrine Entities: 0.85-0.95
- Administrative & Governmental: 0.80-0.90
- Document Structure Elements: 0.75-0.85
- Enhanced Pattern Categories: 0.70-0.85

## Special Instructions

### For Supporting Entities:
1. **Exact Text**: Preserve exact text as it appears
2. **Position Accuracy**: Ensure start_pos and end_pos are accurate
3. **No Overlaps**: Avoid overlaps with Waves 1-2 entities
4. **Normalization**: Provide standardized formats (phone numbers, addresses)
5. **Component Parsing**: Break down addresses, phone numbers

### For Constitutional & Doctrine Entities:
1. **Precision**: Distinguish between general references and specific clauses
2. **Context**: Include surrounding legal context in metadata
3. **Avoid Citations**: Don't extract formal citations (Wave 1 handles CONSTITUTIONAL_CITATION)
4. **Doctrine Names**: Extract doctrine names, not full explanations

### For Structural Elements:
1. **Formatting Preservation**: Maintain document structure markers
2. **Block Identification**: Identify complete signature/witness/notary blocks
3. **Header Hierarchy**: Distinguish between article, section, paragraph headers

## Validation Checks

- Verify all entities meet confidence threshold (‚â•0.70)
- Ensure no duplicate text extractions
- Validate position boundaries don't exceed text length
- Confirm entity_type matches allowed types for this wave
- Check that confidence scores are in valid range [0.0, 1.0]
- Verify no overlaps with Waves 1-2 entities (check previous_results)
- Validate component parsing accuracy

## Wave 3 Focus

Extract ALL qualifying supporting entities, constitutional references, legal doctrines, and structural elements meeting the confidence threshold. This is Wave 3 of 4 - the wave captures contextual legal concepts and document structure.

**Wave 1** extracted: Case citations, statute citations, parties, attorneys, courts, judges, legal citations, temporal entities (92 types).

**Wave 2** extracted: Case numbers, docket numbers, motions, briefs, procedural rules, monetary amounts, damages, fines, fees, awards, law firms, prosecutors, public defenders, government entities (29 types).

**Wave 3** extracts: Contact information, constitutional entities, legal doctrines, administrative references, structural elements (40 types).

**Wave 4** will extract: Entity relationships for knowledge graph construction (40+ relationship types).

Complete Wave 3 extraction now with entities meeting confidence thresholds by category.
