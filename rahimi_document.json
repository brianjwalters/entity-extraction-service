RAHIMI\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 22\u2013915.  Argued November 7, 2023\u2014Decided June 21, 2024\n\nRespondent Zackey Rahimi was indicted under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(8), a\nfederal statute that prohibits individuals subject to a domestic violence\nrestraining order from possessing a firearm.  A prosecution under Sec-\ntion 922(g)(8) may proceed only if the restraining order meets certain\nstatutory criteria.  In particular, the order must either contain a find-\ning  that  the  defendant  \u201crepresents  a  credible  threat  to  the  physical\nsafety\u201d  of  his  intimate  partner  or  his  or  his  partner\u2019s  child,\n\u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(i),  or  \u201cby  its  terms  explicitly  prohibit[ ]  the  use,\u201d  at-\ntempted use, or threatened use of \u201cphysical force\u201d against those indi-\nviduals, \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  Rahimi concedes here that the restraining\norder against him satisfies the statutory criteria, but argues that on\nits face Section 922(g)(8) violates the Second Amendment.  The District\nCourt  denied  Rahimi\u2019s  motion  to  dismiss  the  indictment  on  Second\nAmendment  grounds.    While  Rahimi\u2019s  case  was  on  appeal,  the  Su-\npreme Court decided New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen,\n597 U. S. 1 (2022).  In light of Bruen, the Fifth Circuit reversed, con-\ncluding that the Government had not shown that Section 922(g)(8) \u201cfits\nwithin our Nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.\u201d  61 F.\n4th 443, 460 (CA5 2023).\n\nHeld: When an individual has been found by a court to pose a credible\nthreat to the physical safety of another, that individual may be tempo-\nrarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment.  Pp. 5\u201317.\n\n(a) Since the Founding, the Nation\u2019s firearm laws have included reg-\nulations to stop individuals who threaten physical harm to others from\nmisusing firearms.  As applied to the facts here, Section 922(g)(8) fits\nwithin this tradition.\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms is among the \u201cfundamental rights\nnecessary to our system of ordered liberty.\u201d  McDonald v. Chicago, 561\n\n\f2\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nSyllabus\n\nU. S. 742, 778.  That right, however, \u201cis not unlimited,\u201d District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 626.  The reach of the Second Amend-\nment is not limited only to  those arms that were in existence at the\nFounding.  Heller, 554 U. S., at 582.  Rather, it \u201cextends, prima facie,\nto all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were\nnot [yet] in existence.\u201d  Ibid.  By that same logic, the Second Amend-\nment permits more than just regulations identical to those existing in\n1791.\nUnder  our  precedent,  the  appropriate  analysis  involves  considering\nwhether  the  challenged  regulation  is  consistent  with  the  principles\nthat underpin the Nation\u2019s regulatory tradition.  Bruen, 597 U. S., at\n26\u201331.    When  firearm  regulation  is  challenged  under  the  Second\nAmendment, the Government must show that the restriction \u201cis con-\nsistent  with  the  Nation\u2019s  historical  tradition  of  firearm  regulation.\u201d\nBruen, 597 U. S., at 24.  A court must ascertain whether the new law\nis \u201crelevantly similar\u201d to laws that our tradition is understood to per-\nmit, \u201capply[ing] faithfully the balance struck by the founding genera-\ntion to modern circumstances.\u201d  Id., at 29, and n. 7.  Why and how the\nregulation burdens the right are central to this inquiry.  As Bruen ex-\nplained, a challenged regulation that does not precisely match its his-\ntorical  precursors  \u201cstill  may  be  analogous  enough  to  pass  constitu-\ntional muster.\u201d  Id., at 30.  Pp. 5\u20138.\n\n(b) Section 922(g)(8) survives Rahimi\u2019s challenge.  Pp. 8\u201317.\n\n(1) Rahimi\u2019s facial challenge to Section 922(g)(8) requires him to\n\u201cestablish  that  no  set  of  circumstances  exists  under  which  the  Act\nwould be valid.\u201d  United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745.  Here,\nSection 922(g)(8) is constitutional as applied to the facts of Rahimi\u2019s\nown case.  Rahimi has been found by a court to pose a credible threat\nto the physical safety of others, see \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(i), and the Govern-\nment offers ample evidence that the Second Amendment permits such\nindividuals to be disarmed.  P. 8.\n\n(2) The Court reviewed the history of American gun laws exten-\nsively in Heller and Bruen.  At common law people were barred from\nmisusing weapons to harm or menace others.  Such conduct was often\naddressed  through  ordinary  criminal  laws  and  civil  actions,  such  as\nprohibitions  on  fighting  or  private  suits  against  individuals  who\nthreatened others.  By the 1700s and early 1800s, though, two distinct\nlegal regimes had developed that specifically addressed firearms vio-\nlence: the surety laws and the \u201cgoing armed\u201d laws.  Surety laws were\na form of \u201cpreventive justice,\u201d 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 251 (10th ed. 1787), which authorized magistrates to\nrequire individuals suspected of future misbehavior to post a bond.  If\nan individual failed to post a bond, he would be jailed.  If the individual\ndid post a bond and then broke the peace, the bond would be forfeit.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n3\n\nSyllabus\n\nSurety laws could be invoked to prevent all forms of violence, including\nspousal abuse, and also targeted the misuse of firearms.  These laws\noften offered the accused significant procedural protections.\n\nThe \u201cgoing armed\u201d laws\u2014a particular subset of the ancient common\nlaw  prohibition  on  affrays,  or  fighting  in  public\u2014provided  a  mecha-\nnism for punishing those who had menaced others with firearms.  Un-\nder  these  laws,  individuals  were  prohibited  from  \u201criding  or  going\narmed, with dangerous or unusual weapons, [to] terrify[ ] the good peo-\nple of the land.\u201d  4 Blackstone 149.  Those who did so faced forfeiture\nof  their  arms  and  imprisonment.    Prohibitions  on  going  armed  were\nincorporated  into  American  jurisprudence  through  the  common  law,\nand some States expressly codified them.  Pp. 9\u201313.\n\n(3) Together, the surety and going armed laws confirm what com-\nmon sense suggests: When an individual poses a clear threat of physi-\ncal violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed.\nSection 922(g)(8) is not identical to these founding-era regimes, but it\ndoes not need to be.  Like the surety and going armed laws, Section\n922(g)(8)(C)(i) applies to individuals found by a court to threaten the\nphysical safety of another.  This prohibition is \u201crelevantly similar\u201d to\nthose founding era regimes in both why and how it burdens the Second\nAmendment  right.  Id.,  at  29.  Section  922(g)(8)  restricts  gun  use  to\ncheck demonstrated threats of physical violence, just as the surety and\ngoing  armed  laws  do.  Unlike  the  regulation  struck  down  in  Bruen,\nSection 922(g)(8) does not broadly restrict arms use by the public gen-\nerally.\n\nThe burden that Section 922(g)(8) imposes on the right to bear arms\nalso fits within the Nation\u2019s regulatory tradition.  While the Court does\nnot  suggest  that  the  Second  Amendment  prohibits  the  enactment  of\nlaws banning the possession of guns by categories of persons thought\nby a legislature to present a special danger of misuse, see Heller, 554\nU. S., at 626, Section 922(g)(8) applies only once a court has found that\nthe defendant \u201crepresents a credible threat to the physical safety\u201d of\nanother,  \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(i),  which  notably  matches  the  similar  judicial\ndeterminations required in the surety and going armed laws.  Moreo-\nver, like surety bonds of limited duration, Section 922(g)(8) only pro-\nhibits firearm possession so long as the defendant \u201cis\u201d subject to a re-\nstraining order.  Finally, the penalty\u2014another relevant aspect of the\nburden\u2014also  fits  within  the  regulatory  tradition.    The  going  armed\nlaws provided for imprisonment, and if imprisonment was permissible\nto respond to the use of guns to threaten the physical safety of others,\nthen  the  lesser  restriction  of  temporary  disarmament  that  Section\n922(g)(8) imposes is also permissible.\n\nThe Court\u2019s decisions in Heller and Bruen do not help Rahimi.  While\nSection  922(g)(8)  bars  individuals  subject  to  restraining  orders  from\n\n\f4\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nSyllabus\n\npossessing  guns  in  the  home,  Heller  never  established  a  categorical\nrule  that  the  Constitution  prohibits  regulations  that  forbid  firearm\npossession in the home.  Indeed, Heller stated that many such prohi-\nbitions, like those on the possession of firearms by \u201cfelons and the men-\ntally  ill,\u201d  are  \u201cpresumptively  lawful.\u201d  Heller,  554  U. S.,  at  626,  627,\nn. 26.  And the Court\u2019s conclusion in Bruen that regulations like the\nsurety laws are not a proper historical analogue for a broad gun licens-\ning regime does not mean that they cannot be an appropriate analogue\nfor a narrow one. Pp. 13\u201315.\n\n(4) The Fifth Circuit erred in reading Bruen to require a \u201chistori-\ncal  twin\u201d  rather  than  a  \u201chistorical  analogue.\u201d   597  U. S.,  at  30.   The\npanel  also  misapplied  the  Court\u2019s  precedents  when  evaluating\nRahimi\u2019s facial challenge.  Rather than consider the circumstances in\nwhich Section 922(g)(8) was most likely to be constitutional, the panel\ninstead focused on hypothetical scenarios where the provision might\nraise constitutional concerns.  P. 16.\n\n(5) Finally,  the  Court  rejects  the  Government\u2019s  contention  that\nRahimi may be disarmed simply because he is not \u201cresponsible.\u201d  The\nCourt used this term in Heller and Bruen to describe the class of citi-\nzens who undoubtedly enjoy the Second Amendment right.  Those de-\ncisions, however, did not define the term and said nothing about the\nstatus of citizens who were not \u201cresponsible.\u201d  P. 17.\n\n61 F. 4th 443, reversed and remanded.\n\nROBERTS,  C.

ZACKEY RAHIMI\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\nAPPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n[June 21, 2024]\n\nCHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS  delivered  the  opinion  of  the\n\nCourt.\n\nA federal statute prohibits an individual subject to a do-\nmestic violence restraining order from possessing a firearm\nif that order includes a finding that he \u201crepresents a credi-\nble threat to the physical safety of [an] intimate partner,\u201d\nor  a  child  of  the  partner  or  individual.\n18  U. S. C.\n\u00a7922(g)(8).  Respondent Zackey Rahimi is subject to such an\norder.  The question is whether this provision may be en-\nforced against him consistent with the Second Amendment.\n\nI\nA\n\nIn December 2019, Rahimi met his girlfriend, C. M., for\nlunch in a parking lot.  C. M. is also the mother of Rahimi\u2019s\nyoung child, A. R.  During the meal, Rahimi and C. M. be-\ngan arguing, and Rahimi became enraged.  Brief for United\nStates 2.  C. M. attempted to leave, but Rahimi grabbed her\nby the wrist, dragged her back to his car, and shoved her in,\ncausing  her  to  strike  her  head  against  the  dashboard.\nWhen he realized that a bystander was watching the alter-\ncation, Rahimi paused to retrieve a gun from under the pas-\n\n\f2\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nsenger seat.  C. M. took advantage of the opportunity to es-\ncape.  Rahimi  fired  as  she  fled,  although  it  is  unclear\nwhether  he  was  aiming  at  C. M.  or  the  witness.  Rahimi\nlater called C. M. and warned that he would shoot her if she\nreported the incident.  Ibid.\n\nUndeterred by this threat, C. M. went to court to seek a\nrestraining order.  In the affidavit accompanying her appli-\ncation, C. M. recounted the parking lot incident as well as\nother assaults.  She also detailed how Rahimi\u2019s conduct had\nendangered A. R.  Although Rahimi had an opportunity to\ncontest C. M.\u2019s testimony, he did not do so.  On February 5,\n2020, a state court in Tarrant County, Texas, issued a re-\nstraining order against him.  The order, entered with the\nconsent of both parties, included a finding that Rahimi had\ncommitted \u201cfamily violence.\u201d  App. 2.  It also found that this\nviolence was \u201clikely to occur again\u201d and that Rahimi posed\n\u201ca credible threat\u201d to the \u201cphysical safety\u201d of C. M. or A. R.\nId., at 2\u20133.  Based on these findings, the order prohibited\nRahimi from threatening C. M. or her family for two years\nor  contacting  C. M.  during  that  period  except  to  discuss\nA. R.  Id., at 3\u20137.  It also suspended Rahimi\u2019s gun license\nfor  two  years.    Id.,  at  5\u20136.    If  Rahimi  was  imprisoned  or\nconfined when the order was set to expire, the order would\ninstead terminate either one or two years after his release\ndate, depending on the length of his imprisonment.  Id., at\n6\u20137.\n\nIn May, however, Rahimi violated the order by approach-\ning  C. M.\u2019s  home  at  night.    He  also  began  contacting  her\nthrough several social media accounts.\n\nIn November, Rahimi threatened a different woman with\na gun, resulting in a charge for aggravated assault with a\ndeadly  weapon.    And  while  Rahimi  was  under  arrest  for\nthat assault, the Texas police identified him as the suspect\nin a spate of at least five additional shootings.\n\nThe first, which occurred in December 2020, arose from\nRahimi\u2019s dealing in illegal drugs.  After one of his customers\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n3\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\n\u201cstarted  talking  trash,\u201d  Rahimi  drove  to  the  man\u2019s  home\nand shot into it.  Brief for United States 3.  While driving\nthe next day, Rahimi collided with another car, exited his\nvehicle, and proceeded to shoot at the other car.  Three days\nlater,  he  fired  his  gun  in  the  air  while  driving  through  a\nresidential neighborhood.  A few weeks after that, Rahimi\nwas speeding on a highway near Arlington, Texas, when a\ntruck flashed its lights at him.  Rahimi hit the brakes and\ncut across traffic to chase the truck.  Once off the highway,\nhe  fired  several  times  toward  the  truck  and  a  nearby  car\nbefore fleeing.  Two weeks after that, Rahimi and a friend\nwere dining at a roadside burger restaurant.  When the res-\ntaurant  declined  his  friend\u2019s  credit  card,  Rahimi  pulled  a\ngun and shot into the air.\n\nThe  police  obtained  a  warrant  to  search  Rahimi\u2019s  resi-\ndence.  There they discovered a pistol, a rifle, ammunition\u2014\nand a copy of the restraining order.\n\nB\nRahimi was indicted on one count of possessing a firearm\nwhile subject to a domestic violence restraining order, in vi-\nolation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(8).  At the time, such a viola-\ntion was punishable by up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment (since\namended  to  15  years).  \u00a7924(a)(2);  see  Bipartisan  Safer\nCommunities Act, Pub. L. 117\u2013159, \u00a712004(c)(2), 136 Stat.\n1329, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(a)(8).  A prosecution under Section\n922(g)(8) may proceed only if three criteria are met.  First,\nthe defendant must have received actual notice and an op-\nportunity  to  be  heard  before  the  order  was  entered.\n\u00a7922(g)(8)(A).  Second, the order must prohibit the defend-\nant  from  either  \u201charassing,  stalking,  or  threatening\u201d  his\n\u201cintimate partner\u201d or his or his partner\u2019s child, or \u201cengaging\nin other conduct that would place [the] partner in reasona-\nble  fear  of  bodily  injury\u201d  to  the  partner  or  child.\n\u00a7922(g)(8)(B).  A defendant\u2019s \u201cintimate partner[s]\u201d include\nhis spouse or any former spouse, the parent of his child, and\n\n\f4\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nanyone  with  whom  he  cohabitates  or  has  cohabitated.\n\u00a7921(a)(32).  Third,  under  Section  922(g)(8)(C),  the  order\nmust  either  contain  a  finding  that  the  defendant  \u201crepre-\nsents a credible threat to the physical safety\u201d of his intimate\npartner or his or his partner\u2019s child, \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(i), or \u201cby\nits  terms  explicitly  prohibit[ ]  the  use,\u201d  attempted  use,  or\nthreatened use of \u201cphysical force\u201d against those individuals,\n\u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii).\n\nRahimi\u2019s restraining order met all three criteria.  First,\nRahimi had received notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore  the  order  was  entered.    App.  2.    Second,  the  order\nprohibited  him  from  communicating  with  or  threatening\nC. M.  Id., at 3\u20134.  Third, the order met the requirements of\nSection  922(g)(8)(C)(i),  because  it  included  a  finding  that\nRahimi  represented  \u201ca  credible  threat  to  the  physical\nsafety\u201d of C. M. or her family.  Id., at 2\u20133.  The order also\n\u201cexplicitly  prohibit[ed]\u201d  Rahimi  from  \u201cthe  use,  attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force\u201d against C. M., sat-\nisfying  the  independent  basis  for  liability  in  Section\n922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  Id., at 3.\n\nRahimi  moved  to  dismiss  the  indictment,  arguing  that\nSection  922(g)(8)  violated  on  its  face  the  Second  Amend-\nment right to keep and bear arms.  No. 4:21\u2013cr\u201300083 (ND\nTex., May 7, 2021), ECF Doc. 17.  Concluding that Circuit\nprecedent  foreclosed  Rahimi\u2019s  Second  Amendment  chal-\nlenge, the District Court denied his motion.  Rahimi then\npleaded  guilty.  On  appeal,  he  again  raised  his  Second\nAmendment challenge.  The appeal was denied, and Rahimi\npetitioned for rehearing en banc.\n\nWhile Rahimi\u2019s petition was pending, this Court decided\nNew York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S.\n1 (2022).  In Bruen, we explained that when a firearm reg-\nulation  is  challenged  under  the  Second  Amendment,  the\nGovernment  must  show  that  the  restriction  \u201cis  consistent\nwith the Nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.\u201d\nId., at 24.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n5\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nIn  light  of  Bruen,  the  panel  withdrew  the  prior  opinion\nand ordered additional briefing.  A new panel then heard\noral argument and reversed.  61 F. 4th 443, 448 (CA5 2023).\nSurveying  the  evidence  that  the  Government  had  identi-\nfied, the panel concluded that Section 922(g)(8) does not fit\nwithin our tradition of firearm regulation.  Id., at 460\u2013461.\nJudge  Ho  wrote  separately  to  express  his  view  that  the\npanel\u2019s ruling did not conflict with the interest in protecting\npeople from violent individuals.  Id., at 461\u2013462 (concurring\nopinion).\n\nWe granted certiorari. 600 U. S. ___ (2023)\n\nII\nWhen a restraining order contains a finding that an indi-\nvidual poses a credible threat to the physical safety of an\nintimate partner, that individual may\u2014consistent with the\nSecond Amendment\u2014be banned from possessing firearms\nwhile the order is in effect.  Since the founding, our Nation\u2019s\nfirearm laws have included provisions preventing individu-\nals  who  threaten  physical  harm  to  others  from  misusing\nfirearms.  As  applied  to  the  facts  of  this  case,  Section\n922(g)(8) fits comfortably within this tradition.\n\nA\nWe  have  held  that  the  right  to  keep  and  bear  arms  is\namong the \u201cfundamental rights necessary to our system of\nordered liberty.\u201d  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 778\n(2010).  Derived from English practice and codified in the\nSecond  Amendment,  the  right  secures  for  Americans  a\nmeans of self-defense.  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 17.  The spark\nthat ignited the American Revolution was struck at Lexing-\nton and Concord, when the British governor dispatched sol-\ndiers to seize the local farmers\u2019 arms and powder stores.  In\nthe aftermath of the Civil War, Congress\u2019s desire to enable\nthe newly freed slaves to defend themselves against former\nConfederates helped inspire the passage of the Fourteenth\n\n\f6\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nAmendment, which secured the right to bear arms against\ninterference by the States.  McDonald,  561 U. S., at 771\u2013\n776.  As a leading and early proponent of emancipation ob-\nserved,  \u201cDisarm  a  community  and  you  rob  them  of  the\nmeans  of  defending  life.    Take  away  their  weapons  of  de-\nfense and you take away the inalienable right of defending\nliberty.\u201d  Cong.  Globe,  40th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  1967  (1868)\n(statement of Rep. Stevens).\n\n\u201cLike most rights,\u201d though, \u201cthe right secured by the Sec-\nond Amendment is not unlimited.\u201d  District of Columbia v.\nHeller, 554 U. S. 570, 626 (2008).  In Heller, this Court held\nthat the right applied to ordinary citizens within the home.\nEven as  we did so, however,  we recognized that the right\nwas never thought to sweep indiscriminately.  \u201cFrom Black-\nstone  through  the  19th-century  cases,  commentators  and\ncourts routinely explained that the right was not a right to\nkeep  and  carry  any  weapon  whatsoever  in  any  manner\nwhatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d  Ibid.

Others\nforbade carrying concealed firearms.  554 U. S., at 626.\n\nIn  Heller,  our  inquiry  into  the  scope  of  the  right  began\nwith \u201cconstitutional text and history.\u201d  Bruen, 597 U. S., at\n22.  In Bruen, we directed courts to examine our \u201chistorical\ntradition  of  firearm  regulation\u201d  to  help  delineate  the  con-\ntours of the right.  Id., at 17.  We explained that if a chal-\nlenged regulation fits within that tradition, it is lawful un-\nder  the  Second  Amendment.  We also  clarified  that  when\nthe Government regulates arms-bearing conduct, as when\nthe  Government  regulates  other  constitutional  rights,  it\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n7\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nbears the burden to \u201cjustify its regulation.\u201d  Id., at 24.\n\nNevertheless, some courts have misunderstood the meth-\nodology  of  our  recent  Second  Amendment  cases.  These\nprecedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in am-\nber.  As  we explained in Heller, for example,  the reach of\nthe  Second  Amendment  is  not  limited  only  to  those  arms\nthat were in existence at the founding.  554 U. S., at 582.\nRather, it \u201cextends, prima facie, to all instruments that con-\nstitute bearable arms, even those that were not [yet] in ex-\nistence.\u201d  Ibid.  By that same logic, the Second Amendment\npermits more than just those regulations identical to ones\nthat could be found in 1791.  Holding otherwise would be as\nmistaken  as  applying  the  protections  of  the  right  only  to\nmuskets and sabers.\n\nAs  we  explained  in  Bruen,  the  appropriate  analysis  in-\nvolves  considering  whether  the  challenged  regulation  is\nconsistent with the principles that underpin our regulatory\ntradition.  597  U. S.,  at  26\u201331.    A  court  must  ascertain\nwhether the new law is \u201crelevantly similar\u201d to laws that our\ntradition is understood to permit, \u201capply[ing] faithfully the\nbalance  struck  by  the  founding  generation  to  modern  cir-\ncumstances.\u201d  Id., at 29, and n. 7.  Discerning and develop-\ning the law in this way is \u201ca commonplace task for any law-\nyer or judge.\u201d  Id., at 28.\n\nWhy and how the regulation burdens the right are cen-\ntral to this inquiry.  Id., at 29.  For example, if laws at the\nfounding regulated firearm use to address particular prob-\nlems, that will be a strong indicator that contemporary laws\nimposing similar restrictions for similar reasons fall within\na permissible category of regulations.  Even when a law reg-\nulates  arms-bearing  for  a  permissible  reason,  though,  it\nmay not be compatible with the right if it does so to an ex-\ntent beyond what was done at the founding.  And when a\nchallenged regulation does not precisely match its histori-\ncal  precursors,  \u201cit  still  may  be  analogous  enough  to  pass\nconstitutional muster.\u201d  Id., at 30.  The law must comport\n\n\f8\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nwith the principles underlying the Second Amendment, but\nit need not be a \u201cdead ringer\u201d or a \u201chistorical twin.\u201d  Ibid.\n(emphasis deleted).1\n\nB\nBearing these principles in mind, we conclude that Sec-\n\ntion 922(g)(8) survives Rahimi\u2019s challenge.\n\n1\n\nRahimi challenges Section 922(g)(8) on its face.  This is\nthe  \u201cmost  difficult  challenge  to  mount  successfully,\u201d  be-\ncause it requires a defendant to \u201cestablish that no set of cir-\ncumstances  exists  under  which  the  Act  would  be  valid.\u201d\nUnited States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987).  That\nmeans  that  to  prevail, the  Government  need only  demon-\nstrate that Section 922(g)(8) is constitutional in some of its\napplications.  And here the provision is constitutional as ap-\nplied to the facts of Rahimi\u2019s own case.\n\nRecall  that  Section  922(g)(8)  provides  two  independent\nbases for liability.  Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i) bars an individual\nfrom possessing a firearm if his restraining order includes\na  finding  that  he  poses  \u201ca  credible  threat  to  the  physical\nsafety\u201d  of  a  protected  person.\nSeparately,  Section\n922(g)(8)(C)(ii)  bars  an  individual  from  possessing  a  fire-\narm if his restraining order \u201cprohibits the use, attempted\nuse,  or  threatened  use  of  physical  force.\u201d    Our  analysis\nstarts  and  stops  with  Section  922(g)(8)(C)(i)  because  the\nGovernment offers ample evidence that the Second Amend-\nment  permits  the  disarmament  of  individuals  who  pose  a\ncredible threat to the physical safety of others.  We need not\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n1 We  also  recognized  in  Bruen  the  \u201congoing  scholarly  debate  on\nwhether courts should primarily rely on the prevailing understanding of\nan  individual  right  when  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  was  ratified  in\n1868 when defining its scope (as well as the scope of the right against the\nFederal Government).\u201d  597 U. S., at 37.  We explained that under the\ncircumstances, resolving the dispute was unnecessary to decide the case.\nId., at 37\u201338.  The same is true here.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n9\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\ndecide whether regulation under Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) is\nalso permissible.\n\n2\nThis Court reviewed the history of American gun laws ex-\ntensively in Heller and Bruen.  From the earliest days of the\ncommon law, firearm regulations have included provisions\nbarring people from misusing weapons to harm or menace\nothers.  The act of \u201cgo[ing] armed to terrify the King\u2019s sub-\njects\u201d was recognized at common law as a \u201cgreat offence.\u201d\nSir John Knight\u2019s Case, 3 Mod. 117, 118, 87 Eng. Rep. 75,\n76  (K.  B.  1686).  Parliament  began  codifying  prohibitions\nagainst such conduct as early as the 1200s and 1300s, most\nnotably in the Statute of Northampton of 1328.  Bruen, 597\nU. S., at 40.  In the aftermath of the Reformation and the\nEnglish Civil War, Parliament passed further restrictions.\nThe Militia Act of 1662, for example, authorized the King\u2019s\nagents  to  \u201cseize  all  Armes  in  the  custody  or  possession  of\nany person . . . judge[d] dangerous to the Peace of the King-\ndome.\u201d  14 Car. 2 c. 3, \u00a713 (1662); J. Greenlee, The Histori-\ncal  Justification  for  Prohibiting  Dangerous  Persons  From\nPossessing Arms, 20 Wyo. L. Rev. 249, 259 (2020).\n\nThe  Glorious  Revolution  cut  back  on  the  power  of  the\nCrown to disarm its subjects unilaterally.  King James II\nhad \u201ccaus[ed] several good Subjects being Protestants to be\ndisarmed at the same Time when Papists were . . . armed.\u201d\n1 Wm. & Mary c. 2, \u00a76, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 440 (1689).\nBy way of rebuke, Parliament adopted the English Bill of\nRights,  which  guaranteed  \u201cthat  the  Subjects  which  are\nProtestants,  may  have  Arms  for  their  Defence  suitable  to\ntheir Conditions, and as allowed by Law.\u201d  \u00a77, id., at 441.\nBut as the document itself memorialized, the principle that\narms-bearing was constrained \u201cby Law\u201d remained.  Ibid.\n\nThrough these centuries, English law had disarmed not\nonly brigands and highwaymen but also political opponents\n\n\f10\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nand disfavored religious groups.  By the time of the found-\ning,  however,  state  constitutions  and  the  Second  Amend-\nment had largely eliminated governmental authority to dis-\narm  political  opponents  on  this  side  of  the  Atlantic.    See\nHeller, 554 U. S., at 594\u2013595, 600\u2013603.  But regulations tar-\ngeting  individuals  who  physically  threatened  others  per-\nsisted.  Such conduct was often addressed through ordinary\ncriminal  laws  and  civil  actions,  such  as  prohibitions  on\nfighting or private suits against individuals who threatened\nothers.  See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 145\u2013146, 149\u2013150 (10th ed. 1787) (Blackstone); 3\nid.,  at  120.    By  the  1700s  and  early  1800s,  however,  two\ndistinct  legal  regimes  had  developed  that  specifically  ad-\ndressed firearms violence.\n\nThe first were the surety laws.  A form of \u201cpreventive jus-\ntice,\u201d these laws derived from the ancient practice of frank-\npledges.  4 id., at 251\u2013253.  Reputedly dating to the time of\nCanute, the frankpledge system involved compelling adult\nmen  to  organize  themselves  into  ten-man  \u201ctithing[s].\u201d    A.\nLefroy, Anglo-Saxon Period of English Law, Part II, 26 Yale\nL. J.  388,  391  (1917).  The  members  of  each  tithing  then\n\u201cmutually  pledge[d]  for  each  other\u2019s  good  behaviour.\u201d    4\nBlackstone 252.  Should any of the ten break the law, the\nremaining nine would be responsible for producing him in\ncourt,  or  else  face  punishment  in his  stead.    D.  Levinson,\nCollective Sanctions, 56 Stan. L. Rev. 345, 358 (2003).\n\nEventually,  the  communal  frankpledge  system  evolved\ninto  the  individualized  surety  regime.    Under  the  surety\nlaws, a magistrate could \u201coblig[e] those persons, [of] whom\nthere is a probable ground to suspect of future misbehav-\niour,  to  stipulate  with  and  to  give  full  assurance  . . .  that\nsuch  offence  . . .  shall  not  happen[,]  by  finding  pledges  or\nsecurities.\u201d  4 Blackstone 251.  In other words, the law au-\nthorized magistrates to require individuals suspected of fu-\nture  misbehavior  to  post  a  bond.  Ibid.   If  an  individual\nfailed to post a bond,  he would be jailed.  See,  e.g., Mass.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n11\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nRev. Stat., ch. 134, \u00a76 (1836).  If the individual did post a\nbond and then broke the peace, the bond would be forfeit.  4\nBlackstone 253.\n\nWell  entrenched  in  the  common  law,  the  surety  laws\ncould be invoked to prevent all forms of violence, including\nspousal  abuse.    As  Blackstone  explained,  \u201c[w]ives  [could]\ndemand [sureties] against their husbands; or husbands, if\nnecessary,  against  their  wives.\u201d  Id.,  at  254.  These  often\ntook the form of a surety of the peace, meaning that the de-\nfendant pledged to \u201ckeep the peace.\u201d  Id., at 252\u2013253; see R.\nBloch,  The  American  Revolution,  Wife  Beating,  and  the\nEmergent Value of Privacy, 5 Early American Studies 223,\n232\u2013233, 234\u2013235 (2007) (Bloch) (discussing peace bonds).\nWives also demanded sureties for good behavior, whereby a\nhusband pledged to \u201cdemean and behave himself well.\u201d  4\nBlackstone 253; see Bloch 232\u2013233, 234\u2013235, and n. 34.\n\nWhile  communities  sometimes  resorted  to  public  sham-\ning  or  vigilante  justice  to  chastise  abusers,  sureties  pro-\nvided  the  public  with  a  more  measured  solution.  B.\nMcConville, The Rise of Rough Music, in Riot and Revelry\nin Early America 90\u2013100 (W. Pencak, M. Dennis, & S. New-\nman eds. 2002).  In one widely reported incident, Susannah\nWyllys  Strong,  the  wife  of  a  Connecticut  judge,  appeared\nbefore Tapping Reeve in 1790 to make a complaint against\nher husband.  K. Ryan, \u201cThe Spirit of Contradiction\u201d: Wife\nAbuse  in  New  England,  1780\u20131820,  13  Early  American\nStudies 586, 602 (2015).  Newspapers carried the story in\nConnecticut, Massachusetts, and New York.  Ibid.  Reeve\nultimately ordered the man to post a bond of \u00a31,000.  Id., at\n603.\n\nImportantly  for  this  case,  the  surety  laws  also  targeted\nthe  misuse  of  firearms.  In  1795,  for  example,  Massachu-\nsetts enacted a law authorizing justices of the peace to \u201car-\nrest\u201d all who \u201cgo armed offensively [and] require of the of-\nfender  to  find  sureties  for  his  keeping  the  peace.\u201d    1795\nMass.  Acts  ch.  2,  in  Acts  and  Resolves  of  Massachusetts,\n\n\f12\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\n1794\u20131795, ch. 26, pp. 66\u201367 (1896).  Later, Massachusetts\namended its surety laws to be even more specific, authoriz-\ning  the  imposition  of  bonds  from  individuals  \u201c[who  went]\narmed with a dirk, dagger, sword, pistol, or other offensive\nand dangerous weapon.\u201d  Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 134, \u00a716; see\nibid.  (marginal  note)  (referencing  the  earlier  statute).    At\nleast nine other jurisdictions did the same.  See Bruen, 597\nU. S., at 56, and n. 23.\n\nThese  laws  often  offered  the  accused  significant  proce-\ndural protections.  Before the accused could be compelled to\npost a bond for \u201cgo[ing] armed,\u201d a complaint had to be made\nto a judge or justice of the peace by \u201cany person having rea-\nsonable cause to fear\u201d that the accused would do him harm\nor breach the peace.  Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 134, \u00a7\u00a71, 16.  The\nmagistrate  would  take  evidence,  and\u2014if  he  determined\nthat  cause  existed  for  the  charge\u2014summon  the  accused,\nwho could respond to the allegations.  \u00a7\u00a73\u20134.  Bonds could\nnot be required for more than six months at a time, and an\nindividual could obtain an exception if he needed his arms\nfor self-defense or some other legitimate reason.  \u00a716.\n\nWhile the surety laws provided a mechanism for prevent-\ning violence before it occurred, a second regime provided a\nmechanism  for  punishing  those  who  had  menaced  others\nwith firearms.  These were the \u201cgoing armed\u201d laws, a par-\nticular subset of the ancient common-law prohibition on af-\nfrays.\n\nDerived from the French word \u201caffraier,\u201d meaning \u201cto ter-\nrify,\u201d 4 Blackstone 145, the affray laws traced their origin\nto the Statute of Northampton, 2 Edw. 3 c. 3 (1328).  Alt-\nhough  the  prototypical  affray  involved  fighting  in  public,\ncommentators understood affrays to encompass the offense\nof \u201carm[ing]\u201d oneself \u201cto the Terror of the People,\u201d T. Bar-\nlow, The Justice of the Peace: A Treatise 11 (1745).  Moreo-\nver, the prohibitions\u2014on fighting and going armed\u2014were\noften codified in the same statutes.  E.g., 2 Edw. 3 c. 3; Acts\nand Laws of His Majesty\u2019s Province of New-Hampshire in\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n13\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nNew-England 2 (1761).\n\nWhether classified as an affray law or a distinct prohibi-\ntion,  the  going  armed  laws  prohibited  \u201criding  or  going\narmed,  with  dangerous  or  unusual  weapons,  [to]  terrify[ ]\nthe good people of the land.\u201d  4 Blackstone 149 (emphasis\ndeleted).  Such  conduct  disrupted  the  \u201cpublic  order\u201d  and\n\u201cle[d]  almost  necessarily  to  actual  violence.\u201d    State  v.\nHuntly, 25 N. C. 418, 421\u2013422 (1843) (per curiam).  There-\nfore,  the  law  punished  these  acts  with  \u201cforfeiture  of  the\narms . . . and imprisonment.\u201d  4 Blackstone 149.\n\nIn  some  instances,  prohibitions  on  going  armed  and  af-\nfrays  were  incorporated  into  American  jurisprudence\nthrough  the  common  law.    See,  e.g.,  Huntly,  25  N. C.,  at\n421\u2013422; O\u2019Neill v. State, 16 Ala. 65, 67 (1849); Hickman v.\nState, 193 Md. App. 238, 253\u2013255, 996 A. 2d 974, 983 (2010)\n(recognizing  that  common-law  prohibition  on  fighting  in\npublic remains even now chargeable in Maryland).  More-\nover, at least four States\u2014Massachusetts, New Hampshire,\nNorth  Carolina,  and  Virginia\u2014expressly  codified  prohibi-\ntions on going armed.  1786 Va. Acts ch. 21; 2 Laws of the\nCommonwealth  of  Massachusetts  from  Nov.  28,  1780  to\nFeb.  28,  1807,  pp.  652\u2013653  (1807);  Acts  and  Laws  of  His\nMajesty\u2019s  Province  of  New-Hampshire  in  New-England  2\n(1761); Collection of All of the Public Acts of Assembly, of\nthe Province of North-Carolina: Now in Force and Use 131\n(1751) (1741 statute).\n\n3\n\nTaken together, the surety and going armed laws confirm\nwhat common sense suggests: When an individual poses a\nclear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening\nindividual  may  be  disarmed.    Section  922(g)(8)  is  by  no\nmeans identical to these founding era regimes, but it does\nnot need to be.  See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30.  Its prohibition\non the possession of firearms by those found by a court to\npresent  a  threat  to  others  fits  neatly  within  the  tradition\n\n\f14\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nthe surety and going armed laws represent.\nLike  the  surety  and  going  armed\n\nlaws,  Section\n922(g)(8)(C)(i) applies to individuals found to threaten the\nphysical  safety  of  another.  This  provision  is  \u201crelevantly\nsimilar\u201d to those founding era regimes in both why and how\nit burdens the Second Amendment right.  Id., at 29.  Section\n922(g)(8)  restricts  gun  use  to  mitigate  demonstrated\nthreats  of  physical  violence,  just  as  the  surety  and  going\narmed  laws  do.  Unlike  the  regulation  struck  down  in\nBruen, Section 922(g)(8) does not broadly restrict arms use\nby the public generally.\n\nThe burden Section 922(g)(8) imposes on the right to bear\narms also fits within our regulatory tradition.  While we do\nnot suggest that the Second Amendment prohibits the en-\nactment of laws banning the possession of guns by catego-\nries of persons thought by a legislature to present a special\ndanger of misuse, see Heller, 554 U. S., at 626, we note that\nSection 922(g)(8) applies only once a court has found that\nthe defendant \u201crepresents a credible threat to the physical\nsafety\u201d  of  another.  \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(i).  That  matches  the\nsurety and going armed laws, which involved judicial deter-\nminations  of  whether  a  particular  defendant  likely  would\nthreaten or had threatened another with a weapon.\n\nMoreover, like surety bonds of limited duration, Section\n922(g)(8)\u2019s restriction was temporary as applied to Rahimi.\nSection 922(g)(8) only prohibits firearm possession so long\nas  the  defendant  \u201cis\u201d  subject  to  a  restraining  order.\n\u00a7922(g)(8).  In Rahimi\u2019s case that is one to two years after\nhis release from prison, according to Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\n\u00a785.025(c) (West 2019).  App. 6\u20137.\n\nFinally, the penalty\u2014another relevant aspect of the bur-\nden\u2014also  fits  within  the  regulatory  tradition.    The  going\narmed laws provided for imprisonment, 4 Blackstone 149,\nand if imprisonment was permissible to respond to the use\nof guns to threaten the physical safety of others, then the\nlesser  restriction  of  temporary  disarmament  that  Section\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n15\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\n922(g)(8) imposes is also permissible.\n  Rahimi argues Heller requires us to affirm, because Sec-\ntion 922(g)(8) bars individuals subject to restraining orders\nfrom possessing guns in the home, and in Heller we invali-\ndated  an  \u201cabsolute  prohibition  of  handguns  . . .  in  the\nhome.\u201d  554 U. S., at 636; Brief for Respondent 32.  But Hel-\nler never established a categorical rule that the Constitu-\ntion prohibits regulations that forbid firearm possession in\nthe home.  In fact, our opinion stated that many such pro-\nhibitions, like those on the possession of firearms by \u201cfelons\nand the mentally ill,\u201d are \u201cpresumptively lawful.\u201d  554 U. S.,\nat 626, 627, n. 26.\n\nOur  analysis  of  the  surety  laws  in  Bruen  also  does  not\nhelp Rahimi.  In Bruen, we explained that the surety laws\nwere not a proper historical analogue for New York\u2019s gun\nlicensing regime.  597 U. S., at 55\u201360.  What distinguished\nthe  regimes,  we  observed,  was  that  the  surety  laws  \u201cpre-\nsumed that individuals had a right to . . . carry,\u201d whereas\nNew  York\u2019s  law  effectively  presumed  that  no  citizen  had\nsuch  a  right,  absent  a  special  need.  Id.,  at  56  (emphasis\ndeleted).  Section  922(g)(8)(C)(i)  does  not  make  the  same\nfaulty presumption.  To the contrary, it presumes, like the\nsurety  laws  before  it,  that  the  Second  Amendment  right\nmay only be burdened once a defendant has been found to\npose a credible threat to the physical safety of others.  See\nibid.\n\nWhile we also noted that the surety laws applied different\npenalties than New York\u2019s special-need regime, we did so\nonly to emphasize just how severely the State treated the\nrights of its citizens.  Id., at 57.  But as we have explained,\nour  Nation\u2019s  tradition  of  firearm  regulation  distinguishes\ncitizens  who  have  been  found  to  pose  a  credible  threat  to\nthe physical safety of others from those who have not.  The\nconclusion that focused regulations like the surety laws are\nnot a historical analogue for a broad prohibitory regime like\n\n\f16\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nNew York\u2019s does not mean that they cannot be an appropri-\nate analogue for a narrow one.\n\n4\nIn  short,  we  have  no  trouble  concluding  that  Section\n922(g)(8) survives Rahimi\u2019s facial challenge.  Our tradition\nof firearm regulation allows the Government to disarm in-\ndividuals  who  present  a  credible  threat  to  the  physical\nsafety of others.  Section 922(g)(8) can be applied lawfully\nto Rahimi.\n\nThe dissent reaches a contrary conclusion, primarily on\nthe  ground  that  the  historical  analogues  for  Section\n922(g)(8) are not sufficiently similar to place that provision\nin  our  historical  tradition.  The  dissent  does,  however,\nacknowledge that Section 922(g)(8) is within that tradition\nwhen it comes to the \u201cwhy\u201d of the appropriate inquiry.  The\nobjection  is  to  the  \u201chow.\u201d    See  post,  at  18  (opinion  of\nTHOMAS, J.).  For the reasons we have set forth, however,\nwe conclude that Section 922(g)(8) satisfies that part of the\ninquiry  as  well.  See  supra,  at  7,  13\u201315.  As  we  said  in\nBruen, a \u201chistorical twin\u201d is not required.  597 U. S., at 30.\nFor its part, the Fifth Circuit made two errors.  First, like\nthe dissent, it read Bruen to require a \u201chistorical twin\u201d ra-\nther than a \u201chistorical analogue.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).\nSecond, it did not correctly apply our precedents governing\nfacial  challenges.  61  F. 4th,  at  453.    As  we  have  said  in\nother  contexts,  \u201c[w]hen  legislation  and  the  Constitution\nbrush up against each other, [a court\u2019s] task is to seek har-\nmony, not to manufacture conflict.\u201d  United States v. Han-\nsen,  599  U. S.  762,  781  (2023).    Rather  than  consider  the\ncircumstances in which Section 922(g)(8) was most likely to\nbe constitutional, the panel instead focused on hypothetical\nscenarios  where  Section  922(g)(8)  might  raise  constitu-\ntional concerns.  See 61 F. 4th, at 459; id., at 465\u2013467 (Ho,\nJ.,  concurring).    That  error  left  the  panel  slaying  a  straw\n\n\fCite as:  602 U.

It  is  unclear  what\nsuch a rule would entail.  Nor does such a line derive from\nour case law.  In Heller and Bruen, we used the term \u201cre-\nsponsible\u201d to describe the class of ordinary citizens who un-\ndoubtedly  enjoy  the  Second  Amendment  right.  See,  e.g.,\nHeller, 554 U. S., at 635; Bruen, 597 U. S., at 70.  But those\ndecisions did not define the term and said nothing about the\nstatus of citizens who were not \u201cresponsible.\u201d  The question\nwas simply not presented.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\nIn Heller, McDonald, and Bruen, this Court did not \u201cun-\ndertake  an  exhaustive  historical  analysis  . . .  of  the  full\nscope of the Second Amendment.\u201d  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 31.\nNor do we do so today.  Rather, we conclude only this: An\nindividual found by a court to pose a credible threat to the\nphysical  safety  of  another  may  be  temporarily  disarmed\nconsistent with the Second Amendment.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2 Many of the potential faults that the Fifth Circuit identifies in Section\n922(g)(8) appear to sound in due process rather than the Second Amend-\nment.  E.g., 61 F. 4th, at 459; id., at 465\u2013467 (Ho, J., concurring).  As we\nhave explained, unless these hypothetical faults occur in every case, they\ndo not justify invalidating Section 922(g)(8) on its face.  See United States\nv. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987) (a facial challenge fails if the law is\nconstitutional in at least some of its applications).  In any event, we need\nnot address any due process concern here because this challenge was not\nlitigated as a due process challenge and there is no such claim before us.\nSee this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a).\n\n\f18\n\nUNITED STATES v.

ZACKEY RAHIMI\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\nAPPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n[June 21, 2024]\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with  whom  JUSTICE KAGAN  joins,\n\nconcurring.\n\nToday, the Court applies its decision in New York State\nRifle  &  Pistol  Assn.,  Inc.  v.  Bruen,  597  U. S.  1  (2022),  for\nthe  first  time.    Although  I  continue  to  believe  that  Bruen\nwas wrongly decided, see id., at 83\u2013133 (Breyer, J., joined\nby  SOTOMAYOR  and  KAGAN,  JJ.,  dissenting),  I  join  the\nCourt\u2019s  opinion  applying  that  precedent  to  uphold  18\nU. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(8).\n\nThe Court today emphasizes that a challenged regulation\n\u201cmust  comport  with  the  principles  underlying  the  Second\nAmendment,\u201d but need not have a precise historical match.\nAnte, at 7\u20138.  I agree.  I write separately to highlight why\nthe Court\u2019s interpretation of Bruen, and not the dissent\u2019s, is\nthe right one.  In short, the Court\u2019s interpretation permits\na  historical  inquiry  calibrated  to  reveal  something  useful\nand transferable to the present day, while the dissent would\nmake the historical inquiry so exacting as to be useless, a\ntoo-sensitive alarm that sounds whenever a regulation did\nnot exist in an essentially identical form at the founding.\n\nI\n  Even under Bruen, this is an easy case.  Section 922(g)(8)\nprohibits  an  individual  subject  to  a  domestic  violence  re-\nstraining order from possessing a firearm, so long as certain\ncriteria  are  met.  See  ante,  at  3\u20134.    Section  922(g)(8)  is\n\n\f2\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nSOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nwholly consistent with the Nation\u2019s history and tradition of\nfirearm regulation.\n\nThe Court correctly concludes that \u201cthe Second Amend-\nment  permits  the  disarmament  of  individuals  who  pose  a\ncredible threat to the physical safety of others.\u201d  Ante, at 8.\nThat conclusion finds historical support in both the surety\nlaws, which \u201cprovided a mechanism for preventing violence\nbefore it occurred\u201d by requiring an individual who posed a\ncredible threat of violence to another to post a surety, and\nthe \u201cgoing armed\u201d laws, which \u201cprovided a mechanism for\npunishing  those  who  had  menaced  others  with  firearms\u201d\nthrough  forfeiture  of  the  arms  or imprisonment.  Ante,  at\n12.  \u201cTaken together, the surety and going armed laws con-\nfirm  what  common  sense  suggests:  When  an  individual\nposes  a  clear  threat  of  physical  violence  to  another,  the\nthreatening individual may be disarmed.\u201d  Ante, at 13.  Sec-\ntion 922(g)(8)\u2019s prohibition on gun possession for individu-\nals subject to domestic violence restraining orders is part of\nthat \u201ctradition of firearm regulation allow[ing] the Govern-\nment to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to\nthe physical safety of others,\u201d ante, at 16, as are the similar\nrestrictions that have been adopted by 48 States and Terri-\ntories, see Brief for United States 34\u201335, and nn. 22\u201323 (col-\nlecting statutes).\n\nThe Court\u2019s opinion also clarifies an important methodo-\nlogical  point  that  bears  repeating:  Rather  than  asking\nwhether a present-day gun regulation has a precise histor-\nical  analogue,  courts  applying  Bruen  should  \u201cconside[r]\nwhether  the  challenged  regulation  is  consistent  with  the\nprinciples that underpin our regulatory tradition.\u201d  Ante, at\n7  (emphasis  added);  see  also  ante,  at  7\u20138  (\u201cThe  law  must\ncomport with the principles underlying the Second Amend-\nment, but it need not be a \u2018dead ringer\u2019 or a \u2018historical twin\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting  Bruen,  597  U.

Although \u00a7922(g)(8) \u201cis by no\nmeans identical\u201d to the surety or going armed laws, ante, at\n13, it \u201crestricts gun use to mitigate demonstrated threats of\nphysical violence, just as the surety and going armed laws\nd[id],\u201d ante, at 14.  That shared principle is sufficient.\n\nII\nThe  dissent  reaches  a  different  conclusion  by  applying\nthe  strictest  possible  interpretation  of  Bruen.  It  picks  off\nthe  Government\u2019s  historical  sources  one  by  one,  viewing\nany basis for distinction as fatal.  See, e.g., post, at 18 (opin-\nion of THOMAS, J.) (\u201cAlthough surety laws shared a common\njustification with \u00a7922(g)(8), surety laws imposed a materi-\nally  different  burden\u201d);  post,  at  25\u201326  (explaining  that\n\u201c[a]ffray laws are wide of the mark\u201d because they \u201cexpressly\ncarve out the very conduct \u00a7922(g)(8) was designed to pre-\nvent  (interpersonal  violence  in  the  home)\u201d).    The  dissent\nurges a close look \u201cat the historical law\u2019s justification as ar-\nticulated during the relevant time period,\u201d post, at 28, and\na  \u201ccareful  parsing  of  regulatory  burdens\u201d  to  ensure  that\ncourts do not \u201cstray too far from [history] by eliding mate-\nrial differences between historical and modern laws,\u201d post,\nat 15.  The dissent criticizes this Court for adopting a more\n\u201cpiecemeal approach\u201d that distills principles from a variety\nof historical evidence rather than insisting on a precise his-\ntorical analogue.  Post, at 21.\n\nIf the dissent\u2019s interpretation of Bruen were the law, then\nBruen really would be the \u201cone-way ratchet\u201d that I and the\nother dissenters in that case feared, \u201cdisqualify[ing] virtu-\nally any \u2018representative historical analogue\u2019 and mak[ing]\nit  nearly  impossible  to  sustain  common-sense  regulations\nnecessary to our Nation\u2019s safety and security.\u201d  597 U. S., at\n112 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Thankfully, the Court rejects\nthat rigid approach to the historical inquiry.  As the Court\nputs  it  today,  Bruen  was  \u201cnot  meant  to  suggest  a  law\n\n\f4\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nSOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\ntrapped in amber.\u201d  Ante, at 7.\n\nThis case lays bare the perils of the dissent\u2019s approach.\nBecause the dissent concludes that \u201c\u00a7922(g)(8) addresses a\nsocietal problem\u2014the risk of interpersonal violence\u2014\u2018that\nhas  persisted  since  the  18th  century,\u2019 \u201d  it  insists  that  the\nmeans  of  addressing  that  problem  cannot  be  \u201c \u2018materially\ndifferent\u2019 \u201d from the means that existed in the 18th century.\nPost, at 7.  That is so, it seems, even when the weapons in\nquestion  have  evolved  dramatically.    See  R.  Roth,  Why\nGuns  Are  and  Are  Not  the  Problem,  in  A  Right  To  Bear\nArms?: The Contested Role of History in Contemporary De-\nbates on the Second Amendment 117 (J. Tucker, B. Hacker,\n&  M.  Vining  eds.  2019)  (explaining  that  guns  in  the  18th\ncentury  took  a  long  time  to  load,  typically  fired  only  one\nshot, and often misfired).  According to the dissent, the so-\nlution cannot be \u201cmaterially different\u201d even when societal\nperception of the problem has changed, and even if it is now\nclear  to  everyone  that  the  historical  means  of  addressing\nthe  problem  had  been  wholly  inadequate.  Given  the  fact\nthat the law at the founding was more likely to protect hus-\nbands who abused their spouses than offer some measure\nof  accountability,  see,  e.g.,  R.  Siegel,  \u201cThe  Rule  of  Love\u201d:\nWife  Beating  as  Prerogative  and  Privacy,  105  Yale  L. J.\n2117, 2154\u20132170 (1996), it is no surprise that that genera-\ntion  did  not  have  an  equivalent  to  \u00a7922(g)(8).  Under  the\ndissent\u2019s approach, the legislatures of today would be lim-\nited not by a distant generation\u2019s determination that such\na  law  was  unconstitutional,  but  by  a  distant  generation\u2019s\nfailure to consider that such a law might be necessary.  His-\ntory has a role to play in Second Amendment analysis, but\na rigid adherence to history, (particularly history predating\nthe inclusion of women and people of color as full members\nof  the  polity),  impoverishes  constitutional  interpretation\nand hamstrings our democracy.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n5\n\nSOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nIII\nThe Court today clarifies Bruen\u2019s historical inquiry and\nrejects the dissent\u2019s exacting historical test.  I welcome that\ndevelopment.  That being said, I remain troubled by Bruen\u2019s\nmyopic  focus  on  history  and  tradition,  which  fails  to  give\nfull consideration to the real and present stakes of the prob-\nlems  facing  our  society  today.    In  my  view,  the  Second\nAmendment allows legislators \u201cto take account of the seri-\nous problems posed by gun violence,\u201d Bruen, 597 U. S., at\n91 (Breyer, J., dissenting), not merely by asking what their\npredecessors at the time of the founding or Reconstruction\nthought, but by listening to their constituents and crafting\nnew  and  appropriately  tailored  solutions.  Under  the\nmeans-end scrutiny  that this Court rejected in  Bruen but\n\u201cregularly use[s] . . . in cases involving other constitutional\nprovisions,\u201d id., at 106, the constitutionality of \u00a7922(g)(8) is\neven more readily apparent.*\n\nTo  start,  the  Government  has  a  compelling  interest  in\nkeeping firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers.  A\nwoman who lives in a house with a domestic abuser is five\ntimes more likely to be murdered if the abuser has access\nto a gun.  See A. Kivisto & M. Porter, Firearm Use Increases\nRisk of Multiple Victims in Domestic Homicides, 48 J. Am.\nAcad. Psychiatry & L. 26 (2020).  With over 70 people shot\nand killed by an intimate partner each month in the United\nStates, the seriousness of the problem can hardly be over-\nstated.  See  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n*By \u201cmeans-end scrutiny,\u201d I refer to the mode of analysis that would\npermit courts \u201cto consider the State\u2019s interest in preventing gun violence,\nthe effectiveness of the contested law in achieving that interest, the de-\ngree to which the law burdens the Second Amendment right, and, if ap-\npropriate,  any  less  restrictive  alternatives.\u201d  Bruen,  597  U. S.,  at  131\n(Breyer, J., dissenting).  Prior to Bruen, the Courts of Appeals would ap-\nply a level of means-end scrutiny \u201c \u2018proportionate to the severity of the\nburden that the law imposes on the right\u2019: strict scrutiny if the burden is\nsevere, and intermediate scrutiny if it is not.\u201d  Id., at 103.\n\n\f6\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nSOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nWISQARS  Nat.  Violent  Death  Reporting  System,  Violent\nDeaths  Report  2020,  https://wisqars.cdc.gov/nvdrs  (show-\ning that 863 people were killed with a firearm by a spouse\nor other intimate partner in 2020).  Because domestic vio-\nlence is rarely confined to the intimate partner that receives\nthe  protective  order,  the  Government\u2019s  interest  extends\neven further.  In roughly a quarter of cases where an abuser\nkilled an intimate partner, the abuser also killed someone\nelse, such as a child, family member, or roommate.  See S.\nSmith, K. Fowler, & P. Niolon, Intimate Partner Homicide\nand Corollary Victims in 16 States: National Violent Death\nReporting System, 2003\u20132009, 104 Am. J. Pub. Health 461,\n463\u2013464 (2014).  Moreover, one study found that domestic\ndisputes were the most dangerous type of call for respond-\ning officers, causing more officer deaths with a firearm than\nany  other  type  of  call.  See  N.  Breul  &  M.  Keith,  Deadly\nCalls and Fatal Encounters: Analysis of U. S. Law Enforce-\nment Line of Duty Deaths When Officers Responded to Dis-\npatched  Calls  for  Service  and  Conducted  Enforcement,\n2010\u20132014, p. 15 (2016).\n\nWhile  the  Second  Amendment  does  not  yield  automati-\ncally to the Government\u2019s compelling interest, \u00a7922(g)(8) is\ntailored  to  the  vital  objective  of  keeping  guns  out  of  the\nhands of domestic abusers.  See ante, at 3\u20134, 14.  Section\n922(g)(8)  should  easily  pass  constitutional  muster  under\nany level of scrutiny.\n\nAlthough  I  continue  to  think  that  the  means-end  ap-\nproach to Second Amendment analysis is the right one, nei-\nther party asks the Court to reconsider Bruen at this time,\nand that question would of course involve other considera-\ntions  than  whether  Bruen  was  rightly  decided.    Whether\nconsidered  under  Bruen  or  under  means-end  scrutiny,\n\u00a7922(g)(8)  clears  the  constitutional  bar.  I  join  in  full  the\nCourt\u2019s opinion, which offers a more helpful model than the\ndissent for lower courts struggling to apply Bruen.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U.

Salerno, 481 U. S., at 745.  I agree\nwith  the  Court  that  he  has  failed  to  make  that  showing.\nAnte, at 8.\n\nThat  is  not  because  the  Constitution  has  little  to  say\nabout  the  matter.  The  Second  Amendment  protects  the\n\u201cright of the people to keep and bear Arms.\u201d  \u201c \u2018[T]ext and\nhistory\u2019 \u201d dictate the contours of that right.  Ante, at 6 (quot-\ning New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597\nU. S. 1, 22 (2022)).  As this Court has recognized, too, the\nAmendment\u2019s  text  \u201c \u2018guarantee[s]  the  individual  right  to\npossess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.\u2019 \u201d  Id.,\nat 32 (quoting District of Columbia v.

RAHIMI\n\nGORSUCH, J., concurring\n\nof the Second Amendment.  So, in this facial challenge, the\nquestion becomes whether that law, in at least some of its\napplications, is consistent with historic firearm regulations.\nTo prevail, the government need not show that the current\nlaw is a \u201c \u2018dead ringer\u2019 \u201d for some historical analogue.  Ante,\nat 8 (quoting Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30).  But the government\nmust establish that, in at least some of its applications, the\nchallenged law \u201cimpose[s] a comparable burden on the right\nof armed self-defense\u201d to that imposed by a historically rec-\nognized regulation.  Id., at 29; see ante, at 7.  And it must\nshow that the burden imposed by the current law \u201cis com-\nparably justified.\u201d  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 29; see ante, at 7.\n\nWhy do we require those showings?  Through them, we\nseek to honor the fact that the Second Amendment \u201ccodified\na pre-existing right\u201d belonging to the American people, one\nthat carries the same \u201cscope\u201d today that it was \u201cunderstood\nto have when the people adopted\u201d it.  Heller, 554 U. S., at\n592, 634\u2013635.  When the people ratified the Second Amend-\nment,  they  surely  understood  an  arms-bearing  citizenry\nposed some risks.  But just as surely they believed that the\nright protected by the Second Amendment was itself vital\nto  the  preservation  of  life  and  liberty.    See,  e.g.,  1  Black-\nstone\u2019s Commentaries, Editor\u2019s App. 300 (St. George Tucker\ned. 1803) (observing that the Second Amendment may rep-\nresent the \u201cpalladium of liberty,\u201d for \u201c[t]he right of self de-\nfence is the first law of nature,\u201d and \u201cin most governments[,]\nit has been the study of rulers to confine this right within\nthe  narrowest  limits\u201d);  3  J.

Just as\nhere, we have recognized that, in placing this right in the\nConstitution, the people set its scope, \u201cadmitting only those\nexceptions established at the time of the founding.\u201d  Ibid.\nAnd,  just  as  here,  when  a  party  asks  us  to  sustain  some\nmodern  exception  to  the  confrontation  right,  we  require\nthem to point to a close historic analogue to justify it.  See\nGiles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 358\u2013361 (2008).  Just as\nhere, too, we have expressly rejected arguments that courts\nshould proceed differently, such as by trying to glean from\nhistoric  exceptions  overarching  \u201cpolicies,\u201d  \u201c \u2018purposes,\u2019 \u201d  or\n\u201cvalues\u201d to guide them in future cases.  See id., at 374\u2013375\n(opinion  of  Scalia,  J.).    We  have  rejected  those  paths  be-\ncause  the  Constitution  enshrines  the  people\u2019s  choice  to\nachieve certain policies, purposes, and values \u201cthrough very\nspecific means\u201d:  the right of confrontation as originally un-\nderstood  at  the  time  of  the  founding.    Id.,  at  375.    As  we\nhave put it, a court may not \u201cextrapolate\u201d from the Consti-\ntution\u2019s text and history \u201cthe values behind [that right], and\n\n\f4\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nGORSUCH, J., concurring\n\nthen . . . enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve\n(in the courts\u2019 views) those underlying values.\u201d  Ibid.  Pro-\nceeding that way, we have warned, risks handing judges a\nlicense  to  turn  \u201cthe  guarantee  of  confrontation\u201d  into  \u201cno\nguarantee at all.\u201d  Ibid.  As there, so too here:  Courts must\nproceed  with  care  in  making  comparisons  to  historic  fire-\narms regulations, or else they risk gaming away an individ-\nual right the people expressly preserved for themselves in\nthe Constitution\u2019s text.\n\nProceeding with this well in mind today, the Court rightly\nholds that Mr. Rahimi\u2019s facial challenge to \u00a7922(g)(8) can-\nnot  succeed.  It  cannot  because,  through  surety  laws  and\nrestrictions  on  \u201cgoing  armed,\u201d  the  people  in  this  country\nhave understood from the start that the government may\ndisarm an individual temporarily after a \u201cjudicial determi-\nnatio[n]\u201d that he \u201clikely would threaten or ha[s] threatened\nanother with a weapon.\u201d  Ante, at 14.  And, at least in some\ncases, the statute before us works in the same way and does\nso for the same reasons:  It permits a court to disarm a per-\nson only if, after notice and hearing, it finds that he \u201crepre-\nsents  a  credible  threat  to  the  physical  safety\u201d  of  others.\n\u00a7\u00a7922(g)(8)(A), (g)(8)(C)(i).  A court, too, may disarm an in-\ndividual only for so long as its order is in effect.  \u00a7922(g)(8).\nIn short, in at least some applications, the challenged law\ndoes  not  diminish  any  aspect  of  the  right  the  Second\nAmendment  was  originally  understood  to  protect.  See\nBruen, 597 U. S., at 24.\n\nI appreciate that one of our colleagues sees things differ-\nently.  Post, at 6\u20137 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).  But if reason-\nable minds can disagree whether \u00a7922(g)(8) is analogous to\npast practices originally understood to fall outside the Sec-\nond Amendment\u2019s scope, we at least agree that is the only\nproper  question  a  court  may  ask.  Post,  at  5.  Discerning\nwhat the original meaning of the Constitution requires in\nthis or that case may sometimes be difficult.  Asking that\nquestion,  however,  at  least  keeps  judges  in  their  proper\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n5\n\nGORSUCH, J., concurring\n\nlane, seeking to honor the supreme law the people have or-\ndained  rather  than  substituting  our  will  for  theirs.  And\nwhatever indeterminacy may be associated with seeking to\nhonor  the  Constitution\u2019s  original  meaning  in  modern  dis-\nputes,  that  path  offers  surer  footing  than  any  other  this\nCourt has attempted from time to time.  Come to this Court\nwith arguments from text and history, and we are bound to\nreason  through  them  as  best  we  can.  (As  we have  today.)\nAllow judges to reign unbounded by those materials, or per-\nmit  them  to  extrapolate  their  own  broad  new  principles\nfrom those sources, and no one can have any idea how they\nmight rule.  (Except the judges themselves.)  Faithful ad-\nherence to the Constitution\u2019s original meaning may be an\nimperfect guide, but I can think of no more perfect one for\nus to follow.\n\nJust  consider  how  lower  courts  approached  the  Second\nAmendment before our decision in Bruen.  They reviewed\nfirearm regulations under a two-step test that quickly \u201cde-\nvolved\u201d  into  an  interest-balancing  inquiry,  where  courts\nwould weigh a law\u2019s burden on the right against the bene-\nfits  the  law  offered.  See Rogers  v.  Grewal,  590  U. S.  ___,\n___, and n. 1 (2020) (THOMAS, J., joined by KAVANAUGH, J.,\ndissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 5, and n. 1);\nsee also, e.g., Peruta v. County of San Diego, 742 F. 3d 1144,\n1167\u20131168,  1176\u20131177  (CA9  2014);  Drake  v.  Filko,  724\nF. 3d 426, 457 (CA3 2013) (Hardiman, J., dissenting).  Some\njudges expressed concern that the prevailing two-step test\nhad  become  \u201cjust  window  dressing  for  judicial  policymak-\ning.\u201d  Duncan v. Bonta, 19 F. 4th 1087, 1148 (CA9 2021) (en\nbanc)  (Bumatay,  J.,  dissenting).    To  them,  the  inquiry\nworked as a \u201cblack box regime\u201d that gave a judge broad li-\ncense to support policies he \u201c[f]avored\u201d and discard those he\ndisliked.  Ibid.    How  did  the  government  fare  under  that\nregime?  In one circuit, it had an \u201cundefeated, 50\u20130 record.\u201d\nId., at 1167, n. 8 (VanDyke, J., dissenting).  In Bruen, we\nrejected that approach for one guided by constitutional text\n\n\f6\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nGORSUCH, J., concurring\n\nand history.  597 U. S., at 19.  Perhaps judges\u2019 jobs would\nbe easier if they could simply strike the policy balance they\nprefer.  And a principle that the government always wins\nsurely would be simple for judges to implement.  But either\napproach would let judges stray far from the Constitution\u2019s\npromise.  See Heller, 554 U. S., at 634.\n\nOne  more  point:    Our  resolution  of  Mr.  Rahimi\u2019s  facial\nchallenge to \u00a7922(g)(8) necessarily leaves open the question\nwhether the statute might be unconstitutional as applied in\n\u201cparticular circumstances.\u201d  Salerno, 481 U. S., at 751.  So,\nfor  example,  we  do  not  decide  today  whether  the  govern-\nment may disarm a person without a judicial finding that\nhe  poses  a  \u201ccredible  threat\u201d  to  another\u2019s  physical  safety.\n\u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(i); see ante, at 8.  We do not resolve whether\nthe  government  may  disarm  an  individual  permanently.\nSee ante, at 14 (stressing that, \u201clike surety bonds of limited\nduration,  Section  922(g)(8)\u2019s  restriction  was  temporary  as\napplied  to  [Mr.]  Rahimi\u201d).  We  do  not  determine  whether\n\u00a7922(g)(8) may be constitutionally enforced against a per-\nson who uses a firearm in self-defense.  Notably, the surety\nlaws that inform today\u2019s decision allowed even an individ-\nual found to pose a threat to another to \u201cobtain an exception\nif he needed his arms for self-defense.\u201d  Ante, at 12; see also\npost, at 23 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).  Nor do we purport to\napprove in advance other laws denying firearms on a cate-\ngorical basis to any group of persons a legislature happens\nto  deem,  as  the  government  puts  it,  \u201cnot  \u2018responsible.\u2019\u201d\nAnte,  at  17  (quoting  Brief  for  United  States  6);  see  Tr.  of\nOral Arg. 31\u201332; see also post, at 27 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)\n(\u201cNot  a  single  Member  of  the  Court  adopts  the  Govern-\nment\u2019s theory\u201d).\n\nWe  do  not  resolve  any  of  those  questions  (and  perhaps\nothers like them) because we cannot.  Article III of the Con-\nstitution  vests  in  this  Court  the  power  to  decide  only  the\n\u201c \u2018actual  cas[e]\u2019 \u201d  before  us,  \u201c \u2018not  abstractions.\u2019 \u201d    Public\nWorkers v.

Nor  should  future  litigants  and  courts\nread any more into our decision than that.  As this Court\nhas long recognized, what we say in our opinions must \u201cbe\ntaken  in  connection  with  the  case  in  which  those  expres-\nsions  are  used,\u201d  Cohens  v.

The Court reinforces the focus\non text, history, and tradition, following exactly the path we\ndescribed in Bruen.  Ante, at 5\u20138.  And after carefully con-\nsulting  those  materials,  the  Court  \u201cconclude[s]  only  this\u201d:\n\u201cAn individual found by a court to pose a credible threat to\nthe physical safety of another may be temporarily disarmed\nconsistent with the Second Amendment.\u201d  Ante, at 17 (em-\nphasis  added).

When  performing  that\nArticle  III  duty,  the  Court  does  not  implement  its  own\npolicy  judgments  about,  for  example,  free  speech  or  gun\nregulation.    Rather,  the  Court  interprets  and  applies  the\nConstitution  by  examining  text,  pre-ratification  and  post-\nratification  history,  and  precedent.  The  Court\u2019s  opinion\ntoday does just that, and I join it in full.\n\nindividual\n\nThe concurring opinions, and the briefs of the parties and\namici in this case, raise important questions about judicial\nreliance  on  text,  history,  and  precedent,  particularly  in\nSecond Amendment cases.

Rehnquist,  The  Notion  of  a  Living\nConstitution, 54 Texas L. Rev. 693, 697 (1976).\n\nThat is especially true with respect to the broadly worded\nor vague individual-rights provisions.  (I will use the terms\n\u201cbroadly  worded\u201d  and  \u201cvague\u201d  interchangeably  in  this\nopinion.)  For example, the First Amendment provides that\n\u201cCongress  shall  make  no  law\u201d  \u201cabridging  the  freedom  of\nspeech.\u201d  And  the  Second  Amendment,  at  issue  here,\nguarantees  that \u201cthe right of  the  people to keep and bear\nArms\u201d \u201cshall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nRead  literally,  those  Amendments  might  seem  to  grant\nabsolute  protection,  meaning  that  the  government  could\nnever regulate speech or guns in any way.  But American\nlaw  has\nlong  recognized,  as  a  matter  of  original\nunderstanding  and  original  meaning,  that  constitutional\nrights generally come with exceptions.\n\nWith respect to the First Amendment, for example, this\nCourt\u2019s  \u201cjurisprudence  over  the  past  216\u201d\u2014now  233\u2014\n\u201cyears has rejected an absolutist interpretation.\u201d   Federal\nElection Comm\u2019n v.

J. 1, 21\u201322 (1971).  From 1791 to the present, \u201cthe\nFirst  Amendment  has  permitted  restrictions  upon  the\ncontent  of  speech  in  a  few  limited  areas\u201d\u2014including\nobscenity,  defamation,  fraud,  and  incitement.    United\nStates  v.  Stevens,  559  U. S.  460,  468  (2010)  (quotation\nmarks  omitted).    So  too  with  respect  to  the  Second\nAmendment:  \u201cLike  most  rights,  the  right  secured  by  the\nSecond Amendment is not unlimited\u201d; it is \u201cnot a right to\nkeep  and  carry  any  weapon  whatsoever  in  any  manner\nwhatsoever  and  for  whatever  purpose.\u201d  District  of\n\n\f4\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nColumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 626 (2008).\n\nII\n\nA  recurring  and  difficult  issue  for  judges,  therefore,  is\nhow to interpret vague constitutional text.  That issue often\narises (as here) in the context of determining exceptions to\ntextually  guaranteed  individual  rights.  To  what  extent\ndoes  the  Constitution  allow  the  government  to  regulate\nspeech or guns, for example?1\n\nIn many cases, judicial precedent informs or controls the\nanswer (more on that later).  But absent precedent, there\nare really only two potential answers to the question of how\nto  determine  exceptions  to  broadly  worded  constitutional\nrights: history or policy.\n\nGenerally speaking, the historical approach examines the\nlaws, practices, and understandings from before and after\nratification  that  may  help  the  interpreter  discern  the\nmeaning  of  the  constitutional  text  and  the  principles\nembodied  in  that  text.  The  policy  approach  rests  on  the\nphilosophical or policy dispositions of the individual judge.\n\nHistory, not policy, is the proper guide.\nFor more than 200 years, this Court has relied on history\nwhen construing vague constitutional text in all manner of\nconstitutional  disputes.  For  good  reason.    History  can\nsupply  evidence  of  the  original  meaning  of  vague  text.\nHistory is far less subjective than policy.  And reliance on\nhistory is more consistent with the properly neutral judicial\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n1 There  are  two  ways  to  frame  this  point\u2014either  (i)  determining  the\nexceptions  to  a  constitutional  right  or  (ii)  determining  the  affirmative\nscope or contours of that constitutional right.  Either way, the analysis\nis the same\u2014does the constitutional provision, as originally understood,\npermit  the  challenged  law?    This  opinion  uses  the  term  \u201cexceptions,\u201d\nwhich  underscores  that  the  constitutional  baseline  is  protection  of  the\ntextually enumerated right.  See Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wisconsin\nRight to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 482 (2007) (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)\n(stating  in  a  First  Amendment  case  that  \u201cit  is  worth  recalling  the\nlanguage we are applying\u201d).\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n5\n\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nrole than an approach where judges subtly (or not so subtly)\nimpose their own policy views on the American people.\n\nJudges are like umpires, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE has aptly\nexplained.  And in a constitutional system that counts on\nan independent Judiciary, judges must act like umpires.  To\nbe an umpire, the judge \u201cmust stick close to the text and the\nhistory,  and  their  fair  implications,\u201d  because  there  \u201cis  no\nprincipled way\u201d for a neutral judge \u201cto prefer any claimed\nhuman value to any other.\u201d  R. Bork, Neutral Principles and\nSome First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind. L. J. 1, 8 (1971).\nHistory  establishes  a  \u201ccriterion  that  is  conceptually  quite\nseparate  from  the  preferences  of  the  judge  himself.\u201d  A.\nScalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849,\n864  (1989).  When  properly  applied,  history  helps  ensure\nthat  judges  do  not  simply  create  constitutional  meaning\n\u201cout of whole cloth.\u201d  A. Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of\nRules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1183 (1989).2\n\nAbsent  precedent,\n\ntherefore,  history  guides\n\nthe\ninterpretation of vague constitutional text.  Of course, this\nCourt has been deciding constitutional cases for about 230\nyears,  so  relevant  precedent  often  exists.  As  the  Court\u2019s\nopinions over time amply demonstrate, precedent matters\na great deal in constitutional interpretation.\n\nI now turn to explaining how courts apply pre-ratification\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2 The historical approach applies when the text is vague.  But the text\nof the Constitution always controls.  So history contrary to clear text is\nnot  to  be  followed.    See,  e.g.,  INS  v.  Chadha,  462  U. S.  919,  945\u2013959\n(1983); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 546\u2013547 (1969); Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 490\u2013495, and n. 5 (1954); cf. Sedition\nAct of 1798, ch. 74, 1 Stat. 596.  In some cases, there may be debate about\nwhether  the  relevant  text  is  sufficiently  clear  to  override  contrary\nhistorical practices.  See, e.g., NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U. S. 513, 613\n(2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cWhat the majority needs to\nsustain its judgment is an ambiguous text and a clear historical practice.\nWhat it has is a clear text and an at-best-ambiguous historical practice\u201d).\nThe  basic  principle  remains:    Text  controls  over  contrary  historical\npractices.\n\n\f6\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nhistory,  post-ratification  history,  and  precedent  when\nanalyzing vague constitutional text.\n\nA\n\nPre-ratification  history.  When\n\ninterpreting  vague\nconstitutional  text,  the  Court  typically  scrutinizes  the\nstated intentions and understandings of the Framers and\nRatifiers  of  the  Constitution\n(or,  as  relevant,  the\nAmendments).  The Court also looks to the understandings\nof the American people from the pertinent ratification era.\nThose  intentions  and  understandings  do  not  necessarily\ndetermine  meaning,  but  they  may  be  strong  evidence  of\nmeaning.  See  generally,  e.g.,  The  Federalist  (C.  Rossiter\ned.  1961);  Records  of  the  Federal  Convention  of  1787  (M.\nFarrand ed. 1911); Debates on the Federal Constitution (J.\nElliot ed. 1836).\n\nEspecially  for  the  original  Constitution  and  the  Bill  of\nRights, the Court also examines the pre-ratification history\nin  the  American  Colonies,  including  pre-ratification  laws\nand practices.  And the Court pays particular attention to\nthe historical laws and practices in the United States from\nIndependence  in  1776  until  ratification  in  1788  or  1791.\nPre-ratification  American  history  can  shed  light  on\nconstitutional meaning in various ways.\n\nFor  example,  some  provisions  of  the  Constitution  use\nlanguage that appeared in the Articles of Confederation or\nstate  constitutional  provisions.  And  when  the  language\nthat  appeared  in  the  Articles  of  Confederation  or  in  state\nconstitutions is the same as or similar to the language in\nthe U. S. Constitution, the history of how people understood\nthe  language  in  the  Articles  or  state  constitutions  can\ninform  interpretation  of  that  language  in  the  U. S.\nConstitution.  See,  e.g.,  Moore  v.  Harper,  600  U. S.  1,  33\n(2023) (the \u201cFramers did not write the Elections Clause on\na blank slate\u2014they instead borrowed from the Articles of\nConfederation\u201d  as  evidenced  by  their  use  of  \u201cclosely\n\n\fCite as:  602 U.

Those\npre-ratification American laws and practices formed part of\nthe  foundation  on  which  the  Framers  constructed  the\nConstitution  and  Bill  of  Rights.    Indeed,  the  Constitution\ndid  not  displace  but\nlargely  co-exists  with  state\nconstitutions  and  state  laws,  except  to  the  extent  they\nconflict with federal law.  See Art. VI.\n\nOn the other hand, some pre-ratification history can be\nprobative  of  what  the  Constitution  does  not  mean.  The\nFramers  drafted  and  approved  many  provisions  of  the\nConstitution precisely to depart from rather than adhere to\ncertain pre-ratification laws, practices, or understandings.\n\nFor example, the \u201cdefects\u201d of the Articles of Confederation\ninspired some of the key decisions made by the Framers in\nPhiladelphia and by the First Congress in drafting the Bill\nof Rights.

S.\nConstitution.  See, e.g., Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 975 (1991)\n(opinion  of  Scalia,  J.)

Therefore, reflexively resorting to English law or history\nwithout careful analysis can sometimes be problematic because America\nhad fought a war\u2014and would soon fight another in 1812\u2014to free itself\nfrom British law and practices and rid itself of tyrannical British rule.\nSee  The  Federalist  No.  45,  p.  289  (C.

See  generally  Flowers  v.\nMississippi, 588 U. S. 284 (2019); Batson v. Kentucky, 476\nU. S.  79  (1986);  Loving  v.  Virginia,  388  U. S.  1  (1967);\nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954).\n\nIn short, pre-ratification American history\u2014that is, pre-\nlaws,  practices,  and  understandings\u2014can\nratification\ninform interpretation of vague constitutional provisions in\nthe  original  Constitution  and  Bill  of  Rights.  The  same\nprinciple  of  looking  to  relevant  pre-ratification  history\napplies when interpreting broadly worded language in the\nlater  amendments,  including  the  Fourteenth  Amendment\nratified  in  1868.  But  in  using  pre-ratification  history,\ncourts  must  exercise  care  to  rely  only  on  the  history  that\nthe  Constitution  actually  incorporated  and  not  on  the\nhistory that the Constitution left behind.\n\nB\n\ntext  and  determining  exceptions\n\nPost-ratification history.  As the Framers made clear, and\nas this Court has stated time and again for more than two\ncenturies, post-ratification history\u2014sometimes referred to\nas tradition\u2014can also be important for interpreting vague\nconstitutional\nto\nindividual  constitutional  rights.  When  the  text  is  vague\nand  the  pre-ratification  history  is  elusive  or  inconclusive,\npost-ratification  history  becomes  especially  important.\nIndeed, absent precedent, there can be little else to guide a\njudge  deciding  a  constitutional  case  in  that  situation,\nunless  the  judge  simply  defaults  to  his  or  her  own  policy\npreferences.\n\nAfter ratification, the National Government and the state\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncontinue to be subject to the \u201cimpious doctrine in the old world, that the\npeople were made for kings, not kings for the people\u201d?).\n\n\fCite as:  602 U.

As  the  national  and  state  governments  over  time\nhave  enacted  laws  and  implemented  practices  to  promote\nthe  general  welfare,  those  laws  and  practices  have  often\nreflected  and  reinforced  common  understandings  of  the\nConstitution\u2019s authorizations and limitations.\n\nPost-ratification  interpretations  and  applications  by\ngovernment  actors\u2014at  least  when  reasonably  consistent\nand  longstanding\u2014can  be  probative  of  the  meaning  of\nvague constitutional text.  The collective understanding of\nAmericans who, over time, have interpreted and applied the\nbroadly  worded  constitutional  text  can  provide  good\nguidance  for  a  judge  who  is  trying  to  interpret  that  same\ntext decades or centuries later.

RAHIMI\n\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nImportantly, the Framers themselves intended that post-\nratification  history  would  shed  light  on  the  meaning  of\nvague  constitutional  text.    They  understood  that  some\nconstitutional  text  may  be  \u201cmore  or  less  obscure  and\nequivocal\u201d such that questions \u201cdaily occur in the course of\npractice.\u201d  The  Federalist  No.  37,  at  228\u2013229.

In other words,\nMadison  articulated  the  Framers\u2019  expectation  and  intent\nthat  post-ratification  history  would  be  a  proper  and\nimportant tool to help constitutional interpreters determine\nthe meaning of vague constitutional text.\n\nFrom  early  on,  this  Court  followed  Madison\u2019s  lead.    In\n1819, in one of its most important decisions ever, the Court\naddressed  the  scope  of  Article  I\u2019s  Necessary  and  Proper\nClause.  McCulloch  v.  Maryland,  4  Wheat.  316  (1819).\nWriting for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall invoked post-\nratification history to conclude that Congress\u2019s authority to\nestablish a national bank could \u201cscarcely be considered as\nan open question.\u201d  Id., at 401.

With  a  Constitution  and  a  Supreme  Court\nthat are both more than two centuries old, this Court and\nother  courts  are  rarely  interpreting  a  constitutional\nprovision for the first time.  Rather, a substantial body of\nfor  many\nSupreme  Court  precedent  already  exists\nprovisions of the Constitution.\n\nPrecedent  is  fundamental  to  day-to-day  constitutional\ndecisionmaking  in  this  Court  and  every  American  court.\nThe \u201cjudicial Power\u201d established in Article III incorporates\nthe principle of stare decisis, both vertical and horizontal.\nAs Hamilton stated, to \u201cavoid an arbitrary discretion in the\ncourts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down\nby strict rules and precedents\u201d that will \u201cunavoidably swell\nto a very considerable bulk\u201d and \u201cserve to define and point\nout  their  duty  in  every  particular  case  that  comes  before\nthem.\u201d  The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (A. Hamilton).\n\nCourts  must  respect  precedent,  while  at  the  same  time\nrecognizing that precedent on occasion may appropriately\nbe overturned.  See, e.g., Brown, 347 U. S. 483; West Coast\nHotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937); see also Ramos\nv. Louisiana, 590 U. S. 83, 115\u2013132 (2020) (KAVANAUGH, J.,\nconcurring  in  part).    In  light  of  the  significant  amount  of\nSupreme Court precedent that has built up over time, this\nCourt and other courts often decide constitutional cases by\nreference to those extensive bodies of precedent.\n\nEven then, however, text and history still matter a great\ndeal.  When determining how broadly or narrowly to read a\nprecedent;  when  determining  whether  to  extend,  limit,  or\nnarrow a precedent; or in relatively infrequent cases, when\ndetermining whether to overrule a precedent, a court often\nwill  consider  how  the  precedent  squares  with  the\nConstitution\u2019s text and history.  Therefore, the text, as well\nas  pre-ratification  and  post-ratification  history,  may\nappropriately function as a gravitational pull on the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation  of  precedent.

Uphold  a  law  if  it  is  a\ngood idea; strike it down if it is not.  True, the proponents\nof  a  policy-based  approach  to  interpretation  of  broadly\nworded  or  vague  constitutional  text  usually  do  not  say  so\nexplicitly  (although  some  do).  Rather,  they  support  a\nbalancing  approach  variously  known  as  means-end\nscrutiny,  heightened  scrutiny,  tiers  of  scrutiny,  rational\nbasis  with  bite,  or  strict  or  intermediate  or  intermediate-\nplus or rigorous or skeptical scrutiny.  Whatever the label\nof  the  day,  that  balancing  approach  is  policy  by  another\nname.  It requires judges to weigh the benefits against the\nburdens of a law and to uphold the law as constitutional if,\nin  the  judge\u2019s  view,  the  law  is  sufficiently  reasonable  or\nimportant.    See  M.  Barnes  &  E.  Chemerinsky,  The  Once\nand  Future  Equal  Protection  Doctrine?,  43  Conn.  L.

Members\nof N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 125 (1991)\n(Kennedy,  J.,  concurring  in  judgment).    The  Court  has\nemployed balancing only in discrete areas of constitutional\nlaw\u2014and even in those cases, history still tends to play a\nfar larger role than overt judicial policymaking.7\n\nTo be clear, I am not suggesting that the Court overrule\ncases  where  the  Court  has  applied  those  heightened-\nscrutiny tests.  But I am challenging the notion that those\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n7 The Court has articulated a heightened-scrutiny test in some pockets\nof  free-speech  jurisprudence.    But  even  when  invoking  heightened\nscrutiny in that context, the Court still often relies directly on history.\nSee, e.g., City of Austin v. Reagan Nat. Advertising of Austin, LLC, 596\nU. S.  61,  75  (2022)  (a  city\u2019s  regulation  of  solely  off-premises  billboards\nwas  within  \u201cthe  Nation\u2019s  history  of  regulating  off-premises  signs\u201d  as\n\u201cfederal, state, and local jurisdictions have repeatedly relied upon on-/off-\npremises  distinctions\u201d  \u201cfor  the  last  50-plus  years\u201d);  Perry  Ed.

The Court has also used heightened scrutiny in certain\nequal protection cases.  As discussed above, the Equal Protection Clause\nrejected the history of racially discriminatory laws and practices.\n\n\f20\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nthe  ordinary  approach\n\ntests  are\nto  constitutional\ninterpretation.  And I am arguing against extending those\ntests to new areas, including the Second Amendment.\n\nOne  major  problem  with  using  a balancing  approach  to\ndetermine  exceptions  to  constitutional  rights  is  that  it\nrequires  highly  subjective  judicial  evaluations  of  how\nimportant a law is\u2014at least unless the balancing test itself\nincorporates history, in which case judges might as well just\ncontinue to rely on history directly.\n\nThe  subjective  balancing  approach  forces  judges  to  act\nmore  like  legislators  who  decide  what  the  law  should  be,\nrather than judges who \u201csay what the law is.\u201d  Marbury v.\nMadison,  1  Cranch  137,  177  (1803).    That  is  because  the\nbalancing approach requires judges to weigh the benefits of\na law against its burdens\u2014a value-laden and political task\nthat is usually reserved for the political branches.  And that\npower in essence vests judges with \u201ca roving commission to\nsecond-guess\u201d\nlegislators  and  administrative  officers\n\u201cconcerning  what  is  best  for  the  country.\u201d    W.  Rehnquist,\nThe Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 Texas L. Rev. 693,\n698 (1976).  Stated otherwise, when a court \u201cdoes not have\na  solid  textual  anchor  or  an  established  social  norm  from\nwhich  to  derive  the  general  rule,  its  pronouncement\nappears  uncomfortably  like  legislation.\u201d    A.  Scalia,  The\nRule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1185\n(1989).\n\nMoreover,  the  balancing  approach  is  ill-defined.    Some\njudges will apply heightened scrutiny with a presumption\nin favor of deference to the legislature.  Other judges will\napply  heightened  scrutiny  with  a  presumption  in  favor  of\nthe individual right in question.  Because it is unmoored,\nthe  balancing  approach  presents  the  real  \u201cdanger\u201d  that\n\u201cjudges will mistake their own predilections for the law.\u201d  A.\nScalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849,\n863 (1989).  Under the balancing approach, to use Justice\nScalia\u2019s  characteristically  vivid  description,  if  \u201cWe  The\n\n\fCite as:  602 U.

Chicago,  561  U. S.  742,  803  (2010)\n(concurring opinion) (quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe  balancing  approach  can  be  antithetical  to  the\nprinciple that judges must act like umpires.  It turns judges\ninto players.  Justice Black once protested that the Court\nshould not balance away bedrock free speech protections for\nthe perceived policy needs of the moment.  He argued that\n\u201cthe  balancing  approach\u201d  \u201cdisregards  all  of  the  unique\nfeatures  of  our  Constitution\u201d  by  giving  \u201cthe  Court,  along\nwith Congress, a greater power, that of overriding the plain\ncommands  of  the  Bill  of  Rights  on  a  finding  of  weighty\npublic interest.\u201d  H. Black, The Bill of Rights, 35 N. Y. U. L.\nRev. 865, 878\u2013879 (1960).  Like Justice Black, the Court in\nHeller cautioned that a \u201cconstitutional guarantee subject to\nfuture\nis  no\nconstitutional guarantee at all.\u201d  554 U. S. 570, 634 (2008).\nSome respond that history can be difficult to decipher.  It\nis true that using history to interpret vague text can require\n\u201cnuanced  judgments,\u201d  McDonald,  561  U. S.,  at  803\u2013804\n(Scalia,  J.,  concurring),  and  is  \u201csometimes  inconclusive,\u201d\nScalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev., at\n864.  But at a minimum, history tends to narrow the range\nof  possible  meanings  that  may  be  ascribed  to  vague\nconstitutional  language.  A  history-based  methodology\nimposes  a  neutral  and\nsupplies  direction  and\njudicial\nconstraint\ninfused\ndemocratically\ndecisionmaking.\n\njudges\u2019  assessments  of\n\nits  usefulness\n\non\n\nThe historical approach is not perfect.  But \u201cthe question\nto be decided is not whether the historically focused method\nis  a  perfect  means  of  restraining  aristocratic  judicial\nConstitution-writing;  but  whether  it  is  the  best  means\navailable in an imperfect world.\u201d  McDonald, 561 U.

Moreover, the historical approach \u201cintrudes\nless  upon  the  democratic  process  because  the  rights  it\nacknowledges  are  those  established  by  a  constitutional\nhistory  formed  by  democratic  decisions;  and  the  rights  it\nfails to acknowledge are left to be democratically adopted or\nrejected by the people.\u201d  Id., at 805.\n\nIV\n\nThis  Court\u2019s  Second  Amendment  jurisprudence  has\ncarefully followed and reinforced the Court\u2019s longstanding\napproach to constitutional interpretation\u2014relying on text,\npre-ratification\nand\nprecedent.\n\npost-ratification  history,\n\nand\n\nIn  Heller,  the  Court  began  with  the  baseline  point  that\nthe Second Amendment textually guarantees an individual\n  The  Court  then  explained  that  the  Second\nright.\nAmendment  right  is,  of  course,  \u201cnot  a  right  to  keep  and\ncarry  any  weapon  whatsoever  in  any  manner  whatsoever\nand  for  whatever  purpose\u201d  and  is  subject  to  \u201cimportant\u201d\nlimitations.  554 U.

The Court  examines \u201cour historical tradition of\nfirearm  regulation,\u201d  ante,  at  6  (quotation  marks  omitted),\nand  correctly  holds  that  America\u2019s  \u201ctradition  of  firearm\nregulation  allows  the  Government  to  disarm  individuals\nwho  present  a  credible  threat  to  the  physical  safety  of\nothers,\u201d ante, at 16.  The law before us \u201cfits neatly within\nthe tradition the surety and going armed laws represent.\u201d\nAnte, at 13\u201314.\n\nAs the Court\u2019s decision today notes, Second Amendment\n\n\f24\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\njurisprudence is still in the relatively early innings, unlike\nthe  First,  Fourth,  and  Sixth  Amendments,  for  example.\nThat is because the Court did not have occasion to recognize\nthe  Second  Amendment\u2019s  individual  right  until  recently.\nSee generally Heller v. District of Columbia, 670 F. 3d 1244,\n1269\u20131296  (CADC  2011)  (Kavanaugh,  J.,  dissenting).\nDeciding  constitutional  cases  in  a  still-developing  area  of\nthis Court\u2019s jurisprudence can sometimes be difficult.  But\nthat is not a permission slip for a judge to let constitutional\nanalysis morph into policy preferences under the guise of a\nbalancing  test  that  churns  out  the  judge\u2019s  own  policy\nbeliefs.\n\n*\n\n*\n\ntoday,\n\nconstitutional\n\n*\nAs  exemplified  by  Heller,  McDonald,  Bruen,  and  the\nCourt\u2019s  opinion\ninterpretation\nproperly  takes  account  of  text,  pre-ratification  and  post-\nratification history, and precedent.  Those are the tools of\nthe trade for an American judge interpreting the American\nConstitution.  Of course, difficult subsidiary questions can\narise about how to apply those tools, both generally and in\nparticular  cases.  And  in  some  cases,  text,  history,  and\nprecedent may point in somewhat different directions.  In\nlaw as in life, nothing is perfect.  But in Second Amendment\ncases  as  in  other  constitutional  cases,  text,  history,  and\nprecedent must remain paramount.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U.

It  codified  a  pre-existing  right,  and  pre-\nexisting limits on that right are part and parcel of it.  Dis-\ntrict of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 595, 627 (2008).\nThose limits define the scope of \u201cthe right to bear arms\u201d as\nit was originally understood; to identify them, courts must\nexamine  our  \u201chistorical  tradition  of  firearm  regulation.\u201d\nNew York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S.\n1, 17, 19 (2022).  That evidence marks where the right stops\nand the State\u2019s authority to regulate begins.  A regulation\nis  constitutional  only  if  the  government  affirmatively\nproves that it is \u201cconsistent with the Second Amendment\u2019s\ntext and historical understanding.\u201d  Id., at 26.\n\nBecause the Court has taken an originalist approach to\nthe Second Amendment, it is worth pausing to identify the\nbasic  premises  of  originalism.    The  theory  is  built  on  two\ncore  principles:  that  the  meaning  of  constitutional  text  is\nfixed at the time of its ratification and that the \u201cdiscovera-\nble historical meaning . . . has legal significance and is au-\nthoritative  in  most  circumstances.\u201d    K.  Whittington,\nOriginalism: A Critical Introduction, 82 Ford. L. Rev. 375,\n378 (2013) (Whittington).

So for an original-\nist, the history that matters most is the history surrounding\nthe  ratification  of  the  text;  that  backdrop  illuminates  the\nmeaning of the enacted law.  History (or tradition) that long\npostdates  ratification does  not  serve  that  function.    To be\nsure, postenactment history can be an important tool.  For\nexample, it can \u201creinforce our understanding of the Consti-\ntution\u2019s original meaning\u201d; \u201cliquidate ambiguous constitu-\ntional provisions\u201d; provide persuasive evidence of the origi-\nnal  meaning;  and,  if  stare  decisis  applies,  control  the\noutcome.  See Vidal v. Elster, 602 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2024)\n(BARRETT, J., concurring in part) (slip op., at 13\u201314).  But\ngenerally  speaking,  the  use  of  postenactment  history  re-\nquires some justification other than originalism simpliciter.\nIn Bruen, the Court took history beyond the founding era,\nconsidering gun regulations that spanned the 19th century.\n597  U. S.,  at  50\u201370.    I  expressed  reservations  about  the\nscope of that inquiry but concluded that the timing question\ndid not matter to Bruen\u2019s holding.  Id., at 81\u201383 (concurring\nopinion).    It  bears  emphasis,  however,  that  my  questions\nwere about the time period relevant to discerning the Sec-\nond Amendment\u2019s original meaning\u2014for instance, what is\nthe post-1791 cutoff for discerning how the Second Amend-\nment was originally understood?  Id., at 82 (\u201cHow long after\nratification  may  subsequent  practice  illuminate  original\npublic meaning?\u201d).  My doubts were not about whether \u201ctra-\ndition,\u201d standing alone, is dispositive.  Id., at 83 (\u201c[T]oday\u2019s\ndecision should not be understood to endorse freewheeling\nreliance  on  historical  practice  from  the  mid-to-late  19th\ncentury  to  establish  the  original  meaning  of  the  Bill  of\nRights\u201d).  As I have explained elsewhere, evidence of \u201ctradi-\ntion\u201d unmoored from original meaning is not binding law.\nVidal,  602  U.

United States, 599 U. S. 635, 656\u2013657\n(2023) (BARRETT, J., concurring in part and  concurring in\njudgment).\n  \u201cOriginal history\u201d\u2014i.e., the generally dispositive kind\u2014\nplays two roles in the Second Amendment context.  It eluci-\ndates how contemporaries understood the text\u2014for exam-\nple, the meaning of the phrase \u201cbear Arms.\u201d  See Heller, 554\nU. S., at 582\u2013592.  It also plays the more complicated role\nof determining the scope of the pre-existing right that the\npeople  enshrined  in  our  fundamental  law.*    In  Rahimi\u2019s\ncase,  the  Court  uses  history  in  this  latter  way.  Call  this\n\u201coriginal contours\u201d history: It looks at historical gun regu-\nlations to identify the contours of the right.\n\nCourts have struggled with this use of history in the wake\nof  Bruen.  One  difficulty  is  a  level  of  generality  problem:\nMust the government produce a founding-era relative of the\nchallenged regulation\u2014if not a twin, a cousin?  Or do found-\ning-era gun regulations yield concrete principles that mark\nthe borders of the right?\n\nMany  courts,  including  the  Fifth  Circuit,  have  under-\nstood Bruen to require the former, narrower approach.  But\nBruen emphasized that \u201canalogical reasoning\u201d is not a \u201creg-\nulatory straightjacket.\u201d  597 U. S., at 30.  To be consistent\nwith historical limits, a challenged regulation need not be\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n*To  my  mind,  this  use  of  history  walks  a  fine  line  between  original\nmeaning (which controls) and expectations about how the text would ap-\nply (which do not).  See Whittington 383 (\u201cSpecific expectations about the\nconsequences  of  a  legal  rule  are  distinct  from  the  meaning  of  the  rule\nitself \u201d).  Contemporary  government  actors  might  have  been  \u201cwrong\nabout the consequences of their own constitutional rule,\u201d or they \u201cmight\nnot have fully and faithfully implemented the adopted constitutional rule\nthemselves.\u201d  Id., at 384.  Thus, while early applications of a constitu-\ntional rule can help illuminate its original scope, an interpreter must ex-\nercise care in considering them.  Id., at 385\u2013386.  In the Second Amend-\nment context, particular gun regulations\u2014even if from the ratification\nera\u2014do not themselves have the status of constitutional law.\n\n\f4\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nBARRETT, J., concurring\n\nan updated model of a historical counterpart.  Besides, im-\nposing  a  test  that  demands  overly  specific  analogues  has\nserious problems.  To name two: It forces 21st-century reg-\nulations to follow late-18th-century policy choices, giving us\n\u201ca law trapped in amber.\u201d  Ante, at 7.  And it assumes that\nfounding-era legislatures maximally exercised their power\nto regulate, thereby adopting a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d view of leg-\nislative  authority.    Such  assumptions  are  flawed,  and\noriginalism does not require them.\n\n\u201cAnalogical  reasoning\u201d  under  Bruen  demands  a  wider\nlens: Historical regulations reveal a principle, not a mold.\nSee, e.g., 597 U. S., at 28\u201329 (explaining that the Amend-\nment does not apply only to the catalogue of arms that ex-\nisted  in the 18th century, but rather to all weapons satis-\nfying the \u201cgeneral definition\u201d of \u201cbearable arms\u201d (emphasis\nadded));  id.,  at  30\u201331  (discussing  the  \u201c \u2018sensitive  places\u2019 \u201d\nprinciple that limits the right to public carry); cf.

To be sure, a court must be care-\nful not to read a principle at such a high level of generality\nthat it waters down the right.  Pulling principle from prec-\nedent, whether case law or history, is a standard feature of\nlegal reasoning, and reasonable minds sometimes disagree\nabout how broad or narrow the controlling principle should\nbe.\n\nHere, though, the Court settles on just the right level of\ngenerality: \u201cSince the founding, our Nation\u2019s firearm laws\nhave  included  provisions  preventing  individuals  who\nthreaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms.\u201d\nAnte, at 5; see also Kanter v.

Bruen, 597 U. S. 1 (2022).  I disagree with the meth-\nodology of that decision; I would have joined the dissent had\nI been a Member of the Court at that time.  See generally\nid.,  at  83\u2013133  (Breyer,  J.,  dissenting).    But  Bruen  is  now\nbinding law.  Today\u2019s decision fairly applies that precedent,\nso I join the opinion in full.\n\nI write separately because we now have two years\u2019 worth\nof post-Bruen cases under our belts, and the experiences of\ncourts  applying  its  history-and-tradition  test  should  bear\non our assessment of the workability of that legal standard.\nThis case highlights the apparent difficulty faced by judges\non the ground.  Make no mistake: Today\u2019s effort to clear up\n\u201cmisunderst[andings],\u201d ante, at 7, is a tacit admission that\nlower courts are struggling.

We emphasize\nthat  the  Second  Amendment  is  \u201cnot  . . .  a  law  trapped  in\namber.\u201d  Ante, at 7.  It \u201cpermits more than just those regu-\nlations  identical  to  ones  that  could  be  found  in  1791\u201d;  in-\ndeed,  \u201ca  challenged  regulation  [that]  does  not  precisely\n\n\f2\n\nUNITED STATES v.

These clarifying efforts are welcome,\ngiven the many questions Bruen left unanswered.\n\nWhen this Court adopts a new legal standard, as we did\nin Bruen, we do not do so in a vacuum.  The tests we estab-\nlish  bind  lower  court  judges,  who  then  apply  those  legal\nstandards  to  the  cases  before  them.  In  my  view,  as  this\nCourt thinks of, and speaks about, history\u2019s relevance to the\ninterpretation  of  constitutional  provisions,  we  should  be\nmindful that our common-law tradition of promoting clarity\nand consistency in the application of our precedent also has\na lengthy pedigree.  So when courts signal they are having\ntrouble with one of our standards, we should pay attention.\nCf. Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,\n469 U.

To be sure, our\ndecision  in  District  of  Columbia  v.  Heller,  554  U. S.  570\n(2008),  which  first  recognized  an  individual  right  to  keep\nand bear arms for self-defense, see id., at 628, was disrup-\ntive in its own way.  After all, before Heller, \u201c[t]he meaning\nof the Second Amendment ha[d] been considered settled by\ncourts and legislatures for over two centuries,\u201d and \u201cjudges\nand  legislators  . . .  properly  believed  . . .  that  the  Second\nAmendment did not reach possession of firearms for purely\nprivate activities.\u201d  Id., at 676, n. 38 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning).  Nonetheless,  after  Heller,  lower  courts  took  up  the\nnecessary  work  of  reviewing  burdens  on  this  newly  un-\nearthed right.  By the time this Court decided Bruen, every\ncourt  of  appeals  evaluating  whether  a  firearm  regulation\nwas consistent with the Second Amendment did so using a\ntwo-step framework that incorporated means-end scrutiny.\nSee Bruen, 597 U.

Courts must, first, determine whether\n\u201cthe Second Amendment\u2019s plain text covers an individual\u2019s\nconduct.\u201d  Id., at 24.  If it does, \u201c[t]he government must then\njustify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent\nwith the Nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.\u201d\nIbid.\n\nNo one seems to question that \u201c[h]istory has a role to play\nin Second Amendment analysis.\u201d  Ante, at 4 (SOTOMAYOR,\nJ., concurring).  But, per Bruen, courts evaluating a Second\nAmendment  challenge  must  consider  history  to  the  exclu-\nsion of all else.

And dutiful\nlegislators are not the only stakeholders who are far outside their depth:\nBruen also conscripts parties and judges into service as amateur histori-\nans, casting about for similar historical circumstances.\n\n3 The mad scramble for historical records that Bruen requires also sug-\ngests that only those solutions that States implemented in the distant\npast  comport  with  the  Constitution.    That  premise  is  questionable  be-\ncause,  given  the  breadth  of  some  of  the  Constitution\u2019s  provisions,  it  is\nlikely that the Founders understood that new solutions would be needed\nover  time,  even  for  traditional  problems,  and  that  the  principles  they\n\n\f6\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nJACKSON, J., concurring\n\nConsistent analyses and outcomes are likely to remain elu-\nsive because whether Bruen\u2019s test is satisfied in a particular\ncase seems to depend on the suitability of whatever histor-\nical sources the parties can manage to cobble together, as\nwell  as  the  level  of  generality  at  which  a  court  evaluates\nthose sources\u2014neither of which we have as yet adequately\nclarified.\n\nAnd the unresolved questions hardly end there.  Who is\nprotected by the Second Amendment, from a historical per-\nspective?  To what conduct does the Second Amendment\u2019s\nplain  text  apply?  To  what  historical  era  (or  eras)  should\ncourts look to divine a historical tradition of gun regulation?\nHow many analogues add up to a tradition?  Must there be\nevidence that those analogues were enforced or subject to\njudicial  scrutiny?    How  much  support  can  nonstatutory\nsources  lend?  I  could  go  on\u2014as  others  have.    See,  e.g.,\nUnited States v. Daniels, 77 F. 4th 337, 358\u2013360 (CA5 2023)\n(Higginson,  J.,  concurring)  (providing  a  similarly  nonex-\nhaustive list).

It stifles both helpful innovation and democratic engage-\nment to read the Constitution to prevent advancement in this way.

But, in my\nview,  the  Court  should  also  be  mindful  of  how  its  legal\nstandards  are  actually  playing  out  in  real  life.    We  must\nremember  that  legislatures,  seeking  to  implement  mean-\ningful  reform  for  their  constituents  while  simultaneously\nrespecting the Second Amendment, are hobbled without a\nclear,  workable  test  for  assessing  the  constitutionality  of\ntheir proposals.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 54\u201357; cf. Bruen, 597\nU. S., at 90\u201391 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  And courts, which\nare currently at sea when it comes to evaluating firearms\nlegislation, need a solid anchor for grounding their consti-\ntutional pronouncements.

ZACKEY RAHIMI\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\nAPPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n[June 21, 2024]\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.\nAfter New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen,\n597 U. S. 1 (2022), this Court\u2019s directive was clear: A fire-\narm regulation that falls within the Second Amendment\u2019s\nplain text is unconstitutional unless it is consistent with the\nNation\u2019s  historical  tradition  of  firearm  regulation.  Not  a\nsingle historical regulation justifies the statute at issue, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(8).  Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\nI\nSection 922(g)(8) makes it unlawful for an individual who\nis subject to a civil restraining order to possess firearms or\nammunition.  To trigger \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s prohibition, a restrain-\ning order must bear three characteristics.  First, the order\nissues  after  a  hearing  where  the  accused  \u201creceived\nactual  notice\u201d  and  had  \u201can  opportunity  to  participate.\u201d\n\u00a7922(g)(8)(A).  Second, the order restrains the accused from\nengaging in threatening behavior against an intimate part-\nner or child.  \u00a7922(g)(8)(B).  Third, the order has either \u201ca\nfinding  that  [the  accused]  represents  a  credible  threat  to\nthe physical safety of [an] intimate partner or child,\u201d or an\n\u201cexplici[t]  prohibit[ion]\u201d  on  \u201cthe  use,  attempted  use,  or\nthreatened use of physical force against [an] intimate part-\nner or child.\u201d  \u00a7922(g)(8)(C).  If those three characteristics\nare  present,  \u00a7922(g)(8)  automatically  bans  the  individual\n\n\f2\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsubject to the order from possessing \u201cany firearm or ammu-\nnition.\u201d  \u00a7922(g).\n\nJust as important as \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s express terms is what it\nleaves unsaid.  Section 922(g)(8) does not require a finding\nthat a person has ever committed a crime of domestic vio-\nlence.  It is not triggered by a criminal conviction or a per-\nson\u2019s  criminal  history,  unlike  other  \u00a7922(g)  subsections.\nSee  \u00a7\u00a7922(g)(1),  (9).  And,  \u00a7922(g)(8)  does  not  distinguish\ncontested orders from joint orders\u2014for example, when par-\nties voluntarily enter a no-contact agreement or when both\nparties seek a restraining order.\n\nIn addition, \u00a7922(g)(8) strips an individual of his ability\nto possess firearms and ammunition without any due pro-\ncess.1  Rather, the ban is an automatic, uncontestable con-\nsequence of certain orders.  See \u00a7922(g) (\u201cIt shall be unlaw-\nful  for  any  [qualifying]  person  [to]  possess  in  or  affecting\ncommerce, any firearm or ammunition\u201d).  There is no hear-\ning or opportunity to be heard on the statute\u2019s applicability,\nand a court need not decide whether a person should be dis-\narmed  under  \u00a7922(g)(8).  The  only  process  \u00a7922(g)(8)  re-\nquires is that provided (or not) for the underlying restrain-\ning order.\n\nDespite  \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s  broad  scope  and  lack  of  process,  it\ncarries strong penalties.  Any violation of \u00a7922(g)(8) is a fel-\nimprisonment.\nony  punishable  by  up  to  15  years\u2019\n\u00a7924(a)(8); see also ante, at 3.  And, a conviction for violat-\ning \u00a7922(g)(8) itself triggers a permanent, life-long prohibi-\ntion  on  possessing  firearms  and  ammunition.\nSee\n\u00a7922(g)(1).\n\nIn 2020, Zackey Rahimi and his ex-girlfriend, C. M., en-\ntered into a qualifying civil restraining order.  App. 1.  C. M.\nhad  requested  the  order  and  asserted  that  Rahimi  as-\nsaulted  her.   See  id.,  at  2.  Because  the  order  found  that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n1 Rahimi  does  not  ask  the  Court  to  consider,  and  I  do  not  address,\n\nwhether \u00a7922(g)(8) satisfies the Due Process Clause.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n3\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nRahimi presented a credible threat and prohibited him from\nusing physical force against C. M., the order automatically\ntriggered  \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s  firearms  ban.    A  year  later,  officers\ndiscovered  firearms  in  Rahimi\u2019s  home.  Rahimi  pleaded\nguilty to violating \u00a7922(g)(8).\n\nBefore his guilty plea, Rahimi challenged his conviction\nunder  the  Second  Amendment.    He  pointed  to  District  of\nColumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570 (2008), which held that\nthe Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep\nand bear firearms.  Section 922(g)(8), Rahimi argued, vio-\nlates that right by penalizing firearms possession.  The Dis-\ntrict  Court  rejected  Rahimi\u2019s  claim.    At  that  time,  the\nCourts  of  Appeals,  including  the  Fifth  Circuit,  applied  a\nform of means-end scrutiny to Second Amendment claims.\nSee, e.g., United States v. McGinnis, 956 F. 3d 747, 753\u2013754\n(2020).  Applying  Circuit  precedent,  the  Fifth  Circuit  af-\nfirmed the District Court.  2022 WL 2070392 (2022).\n\nRoughly two weeks later, this Court issued its opinion in\nNew  York  State  Rifle  &  Pistol  Assn.,  Inc.  v.  Bruen.  The\nCourt  rejected  the  means-end-scrutiny  approach  and  laid\nout the appropriate framework for assessing whether a fire-\narm regulation is constitutional.  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 17\u2013\n19.  That framework requires the Government to prove that\nthe \u201cregulation is part of the historical tradition that delim-\nits  the  outer  bounds  of  the  right  to  keep  and  bear  arms.\u201d\nId., at 19.  The Fifth Circuit withdrew its opinion to apply\nthe correct framework to Rahimi\u2019s claim.  Relying on Bruen,\nthe Fifth Circuit concluded that the Government failed to\npresent historical evidence that \u00a7922(g)(8) \u201cfits within our\nNation\u2019s  historical  tradition  of  firearm  regulation.\u201d    61  F.\n4th 443, 460 (2023).  The Fifth Circuit, accordingly, vacated\nRahimi\u2019s conviction.  We granted certiorari.  600 U. S. ___\n(2023).\n\nII\nThe Second Amendment provides that \u201c[a] well regulated\n\n\f4\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nMilitia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be in-\nfringed.\u201d  As  the  Court  recognizes,  Bruen  provides  the\nframework  for  analyzing  whether  a  regulation  such  as\n\u00a7922(g)(8)  violates  the  Second  Amendment\u2019s  mandate.\n\u201c[W]hen the Second Amendment\u2019s plain text covers an indi-\nvidual\u2019s  conduct,  the  Constitution  presumptively  protects\nthat conduct.\u201d  597 U. S., at 17.  To overcome this presump-\ntion,  \u201cthe  government  must  demonstrate  that  the  regula-\ntion  is  consistent  with  the  Nation\u2019s  historical  tradition  of\nfirearm  regulation.\u201d    Ibid.  The  presumption  against  re-\nstrictions on keeping and bearing firearms is a central fea-\nture of the Second Amendment.  That Amendment does not\nmerely narrow the Government\u2019s regulatory power.  It is a\nbarrier, placing the right to keep and bear arms off limits\nto the Government.\n\nWhen  considering  whether  a  modern  regulation  is  con-\nsistent with historical regulations and thus overcomes the\npresumption against firearms restrictions, our precedents\n\u201cpoint toward at least two metrics [of comparison]: how and\nwhy the regulations burden a law-abiding citizen\u2019s right to\narmed self-defense.\u201d  Id., at 29.  A historical law must sat-\nisfy both considerations to serve as a comparator.  See ibid.\nWhile  a  historical  law  need  not  be  a  \u201chistorical  twin,\u201d  it\nmust be \u201cwell-established and representative\u201d to serve as a\nhistorical analogue.  Id., at 30 (emphasis deleted).\n\nIn  some  cases,  \u201cthe  inquiry  [is]  fairly  straightforward.\u201d\nId., at 26.  For instance, \u201cwhen a challenged regulation ad-\ndresses a general societal problem that has persisted since\nthe 18th century, the lack of a distinctly similar historical\nregulation  addressing  that  problem  is  relevant  evidence\nthat the challenged regulation is inconsistent with the Sec-\nond  Amendment.  Likewise,  if  earlier  generations  ad-\ndressed the societal problem, but did so through materially\ndifferent means, that also could be evidence that a modern\nregulation is unconstitutional.\u201d  Id., at 26\u201327.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n5\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nThe  Court  employed  this  \u201cstraightforward\u201d  analysis  in\nHeller and Bruen.  Heller considered the District of Colum-\nbia\u2019s \u201cflat ban on the possession of handguns in the home,\u201d\nBruen, 597 U. S., at 27, and Bruen considered New York\u2019s\neffective ban on carrying a firearm in public, see id., at 11\u2013\n13.  The  Court  determined  that  the  District  of  Columbia\nand  New  York  had  \u201caddressed  a  perceived  societal  prob-\nlem\u2014firearm violence in densely populated communities\u2014\nand  [they]  employed  a  regulation  . . .  that  the  Founders\nthemselves could have adopted to confront that problem.\u201d\nId., at 27.  Accordingly, the Court \u201cconsider[ed] \u2018founding-\nera historical precedent\u2019 \u201d and looked for a comparable reg-\nulation.  Ibid. (quoting Heller, 554 U. S., at 631).  In both\ncases,  the  Court  found  no  such  law  and  held  the  modern\nregulations unconstitutional.  Id., at 631; Bruen, 597 U. S.,\nat 27.\n\nUnder  our  precedent,  then,  we  must  resolve  two  ques-\ntions to determine if \u00a7922(g)(8) violates the Second Amend-\nment:  (1) Does  \u00a7922(g)(8)  target  conduct  protected  by  the\nSecond  Amendment\u2019s  plain  text;  and  (2) does  the  Govern-\nment  establish  that  \u00a7922(g)(8)  is  consistent  with  the  Na-\ntion\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation?\n\nIII\n\nSection 922(g)(8) violates the Second Amendment.  First,\nit targets conduct at the core of the Second Amendment\u2014\npossessing firearms.  Second, the Government failed to pro-\nduce any evidence that \u00a7922(g)(8) is consistent with the Na-\ntion\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.  To the con-\ntrary, the founding generation addressed the same societal\nproblem  as  \u00a7922(g)(8)  through  the  \u201cmaterially  different\nmeans\u201d of surety laws.  Id., at 26.\n\nA\nIt  is  undisputed  that  \u00a7922(g)(8)  targets  conduct  encom-\npassed  by  the  Second  Amendment\u2019s  plain  text.  After  all,\n\n\f6\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe  statute  bans  a  person  subject  to  a  restraining  order\nfrom possessing or using virtually any firearm or ammuni-\ntion.  \u00a7922(g)  (prohibiting  covered  individuals  from  \u201cpos-\nsess[ing]\u201d or \u201creceiv[ing] any firearm or ammunition which\nhas  been  shipped  or  transported  in  interstate  or  foreign\ncommerce\u201d).  A  covered  individual  cannot  even  possess  a\nfirearm in his home for self-defense, \u201cthe central component\nof the [Second Amendment] right itself.\u201d  Heller, 554 U.

Id., at\n628\u2013629.\n\nIt is also undisputed that the Second Amendment applies\nto Rahimi.  By its terms, the Second Amendment extends\nto \u201c \u2018the people,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cterm unambiguously refers to all\nmembers  of  the  political  community,  not  an  unspecified\nsubset.\u201d  Id., at 580.  The Second Amendment thus recog-\nnizes a right \u201cguaranteed to \u2018all Americans.\u2019 \u201d  Bruen, 597\nU. S., at 70 (quoting Heller, 554 U. S., at 581).  Since Rahimi\nis a member of the political community, he falls within the\nSecond Amendment\u2019s guarantee.\n\nB\nThe Government fails to carry its burden of proving that\n\u00a7922(g)(8) is \u201cconsistent with the Nation\u2019s historical tradi-\ntion of firearm regulation.\u201d  597 U.

Id., at 26.  Surety laws were, in a\nnutshell, a fine on certain behavior.  If a person threatened\nsomeone in his community, he was given the choice to either\nkeep the peace or forfeit a sum of money.  Surety laws thus\nshared  the  same  justification  as  \u00a7922(g)(8),  but  they  im-\nposed a far less onerous burden.  The Government has not\nshown that \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s more severe approach is consistent\nwith our historical tradition of firearm regulation.\n\n1\nThe Government does not offer a single historical regula-\ntion that is relevantly similar to \u00a7922(g)(8).  As the Court\nhas  explained,  the  \u201ccentral  considerations\u201d  when  compar-\ning modern and historical regulations are whether the reg-\nulations \u201cimpose a comparable burden\u201d that is \u201ccomparably\njustified.\u201d  Id., at 29.  The Government offers only two cate-\ngories  of  evidence  that  are  even  within  the  ballpark  of\n\u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s burden and justification: English laws disarm-\ning persons \u201cdangerous\u201d to the peace of the kingdom, and\ncommentary  discussing  peaceable  citizens  bearing  arms.\nNeither category ultimately does the job.\n\ni\nThe Government points to various English laws from the\nlate 1600s and early 1700s to argue that there is a tradition\nof restricting the rights of \u201cdangerous\u201d persons.  For exam-\nple, the Militia Act of 1662 authorized local officials to dis-\narm individuals judged \u201cdangerous to the Peace of the King-\ndome.\u201d  14  Car.  2  c.  3,  \u00a713.    And,  in  the  early  1700s,  the\nCrown authorized lords and justices of the peace to \u201ccause\nsearch to be made for arms in the possession of any persons\nwhom they judge dangerous, and seize such arms according\nto  law.\u201d  Calendar  of  State  Papers  Domestic:  William  III,\n\n\f8\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n1700\u20131702, p. 234 (E. Bateson ed. 1937) (Calendar William\nIII).\n\nAt first glance, these laws targeting \u201cdangerous\u201d persons\nmight appear relevant.  After all, if the Second Amendment\nright was historically understood to allow an official to dis-\narm  anyone  he  deemed  \u201cdangerous,\u201d  it  may  follow  that\nmodern Congresses can do the same.  Yet, historical context\ncompels the opposite conclusion.  The Second Amendment\nstems from English resistance against \u201cdangerous\u201d person\nlaws.\n\nThe sweeping disarmament authority wielded by English\nofficials during the 1600s, including the Militia Act of 1662,\nprompted  the  English  to  enshrine  an  individual  right  to\nkeep  and  bear  arms.  \u201c[T]he  Stuart  Kings  Charles  II  and\nJames II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to\nsuppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their op-\nponents.\u201d  Heller, 554 U. S., at 592.  Englishmen, as a re-\nsult,  grew  \u201cto  be  extremely  wary  of  concentrated  military\nforces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms.\u201d  Id.,\nat 593.  Following the Glorious Revolution, they \u201cobtained\nan  assurance  . . .  in  the  Declaration  of  Right  (which  was\ncodified  as  the  English  Bill  of  Rights),  that  Protestants\nwould never be disarmed.\u201d  Ibid.\n\nThe English Bill of Rights \u201chas long been understood to\nbe  the  predecessor  to  our  Second  Amendment.\u201d  Ibid.  In\nfact,  our  Founders  expanded  on  it  and  made  the  Second\nAmendment even more protective of individual liberty.  The\nEnglish Bill of Rights assured Protestants \u201cArms for their\nDefence,\u201d but only where \u201csuitable to their Conditions and\nas allowed by Law.\u201d  1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 2, (1688), in 6 Stat-\nutes of the Realm 143.  The Second Amendment, however,\ncontains  no  such  qualifiers  and  protects  the  right  of  \u201cthe\npeople\u201d generally.  In short, laws targeting \u201cdangerous\u201d per-\nsons  led  to  the  Second  Amendment.    It  would  be  passing\nstrange to permit the Government to resurrect those self-\n\n\fCite as:  602 U.

Those laws were driven by\na  justification  distinct  from  that  of  \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2014quashing\ntreason and rebellion.  The Stuart Kings\u2019 reign was marked\nby religious and political conflict, which at that time were\noften one and the same.  The Parliament of the late 1600s\n\u201cre-established an intolerant episcopalian church\u201d through\nlegislation targeting other sects, including \u201c[a] fierce penal\ncode\u201d to keep those other sects out of local government and\n\u201cto criminalize nonconformist worship.\u201d  Oxford Handbook\nof the English Revolution 212 (M.

These laws were driven in large\npart by a desire to suppress rebellion.  \u201cNonconformist min-\nisters  were  thought  to  preach  resistance  to  divinely  or-\ndained monarchs.\u201d  Oxford Handbook 212; see Calendar of\nState  Papers  Domestic:  Charles  II,  1661\u20131662,  p. 161  (M.\nGreen  ed.  1861)  (Calendar  Charles  II)  (\u201c[P]reachers  go\nabout from county to county, and blow the flames of rebel-\nlion\u201d).

It\nprincipally  relies  on  commentary  surrounding  two  failed\nconstitutional proposals.3  First, at the Massachusetts con-\nvention,  Samuel  Adams  unsuccessfully  proposed  that  the\nBill of Rights deny Congress the power \u201cto prevent the peo-\nple of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from\nkeeping  their  own  arms.\u201d    6  Documentary  History  of  the\nRatification  of  the  Constitution  1453  (J.  Kaminski  &  G.\nSaladino eds. 2000) (Documentary History).  Second, Anti-\nFederalists at the Pennsylvania convention unsuccessfully\nproposed a Bill of Rights providing a \u201cright to bear arms for\nthe defense of themselves and their own state, or the United\nStates, or for the purpose of killing game.\u201d  2 id., at 597\u2013\n598, \u00b67 (M.

The Anti-Federalists\u2019 Bill of\nRights would also state that \u201cno law shall be passed for dis-\narming  the  people or  any  of  them,  unless  for  crimes  com-\nmitted,  or  real  danger  of  public  injury  from  individuals.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n3 The Government also cites an amendment to the Massachusetts Con-\nstitution providing that \u201cthe people have a right to keep and to bear Arms\nfor their Own and the Common defence.\u201d  The Popular Sources of Politi-\ncal  Authority:  Documents  on  the  Massachusetts  Constitution  of  1780,\np. 624 (O.

The Government empha-\nsizes that the amendment\u2019s proponents believed they \u201cOught Never to be\ndeprived\u201d of their arms, so long as they \u201cContinue[d] honest and Lawfull\nSubjects of Government.\u201d  Ibid.  Even if the amendment contemplated\ndisarming dishonest and unlawful subjects, the Government makes no\neffort to define those terms or explain why they necessarily include the\nindividuals  covered  by  \u00a7922(g)(8).    In  any  event,  evidence  concerning\nwhat proponents behind an amendment to a single state constitution be-\nlieved is too paltry to define the Second Amendment right.  See Bruen,\n597 U. S., at 46.\n\n\f12\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nId., at 598.\n\nThese  proposals  carry  little  interpretative  weight.    To\nbegin with, it is \u201cdubious to rely on [drafting] history to in-\nterpret a text that was widely understood to codify a pre-\nexisting  right.\u201d  Heller,  554  U. S.,  at  603.    Moreover,  the\nStates rejected the proposals.  Samuel Adams withdrew his\nown proposal after it \u201calarmed both Federalists and Anti-\nfederalists.\u201d  6 Documentary History 1453 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).4  The Pennsylvania Anti-Federalists\u2019\nproposal similarly failed to gain a majority of the state con-\nvention.  2 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary\nHistory 628 (1971).\n\nThe Government never explains why or how language ex-\ncluded from the Constitution could operate to limit the lan-\nguage actually ratified.  The more natural inference seems\nto be the opposite\u2014the unsuccessful proposals suggest that\nthe Second Amendment preserves a more expansive right.\nAfter  all,  the  Founders  considered,  and  rejected,  any  tex-\ntual limitations in favor of an unqualified directive: \u201c[T]he\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be in-\nfringed.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the proposals, the Government throws in a\nhodgepodge of sources from the mid-to-late 1800s that use\nthe phrase \u201cpeaceable\u201d in relation to firearms.  Many of the\nsources simply make passing reference to the notion.  See,\ne.g., H. R. Rep. No. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, p. 229\n(1866)  (proposed  circular  explaining  freed  slaves  \u201chave\nshown by their peaceful and orderly conduct that they can\nsafely be trusted with fire-arms, and they need them to kill\ngame for subsistence\u201d).  Other sources are individual mus-\nings on firearms policy.  See, e.g., The Sale of Pistols, N.

S. ____ (2024)\n\n13\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe law against carrying concealed weapons\u201d).  Sources that\ndo  discuss  disarmament  generally  describe  nonpeaceable\ncitizens  as  those  who  threaten  the  public  or  government.\nFor example, the Government quotes a Union General\u2019s or-\nder that \u201call loyal and peaceable citizens in Missouri will be\npermitted to bear arms.\u201d  Headquarters, Dept. of the Mis-\nsouri, General Orders, No. 86 (Aug. 25, 1863), in The War\nof the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the\nUnion and Confederate Armies, Ser. 1, Vol. 22, Pt. 2, p. 475\n(1888).  Yet, the Government fails to mention that the Un-\nion General\u2019s order addresses the \u201c[l]arge numbers of men\n. . .  leaving  the  broken  rebel  armies  . . .  and  returning  to\nMissouri . . . with the purpose of following a career of plun-\nder and murder.\u201d  Id., at 474.  The order provided that \u201call\nthose  who  voluntarily  abandon[ed]  the  rebel  cause\u201d  could\nreturn  to  Missouri,  but  only  if  they  \u201csurrender[ed]  them-\nselves  and  their  arms,\u201d  \u201c[took]  the  oath  of  allegiance  and\n[gave] bond for their future good conduct.\u201d  Ibid.  By con-\ntrast,  \u201call  loyal  and  peaceable  citizens  in  Missouri  w[ere]\npermitted  to  bear  arms\u201d  to  \u201cprotect  themselves  from  vio-\nlence\u201d  and  \u201caid  the  troops.\u201d    Id.,  at  475.  Thus,  the  term\n\u201cloyal and peaceable\u201d distinguished between the former re-\nbels residing in Missouri who were disarmed to prevent re-\nbellion  and  those  citizens  who  would  help  fight  against\nthem.\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  smorgasbord  of  commentary  proves\nlittle of relevance, and it certainly does not establish a \u201chis-\ntorical tradition that delimits the outer bounds of the right\nto keep and bear arms.\u201d  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 19.\n\niii\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  remaining  evidence  is  even  further\nafield.  The Government points to an assortment of firearm\nregulations, covering everything from storage practices  to\ntreason and mental illness.  They are all irrelevant for pur-\nposes  of  \u00a7922(g)(8).    Again,  the  \u201ccentral  considerations\u201d\n\n\f14\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwhen  comparing  modern  and  historical  regulations  are\nwhether they \u201cimpose a comparable burden\u201d that is \u201ccom-\nparably  justified.\u201d  Id.,  at  29  (emphasis  deleted;  internal\nquotation  marks  omitted).  The  Government\u2019s  evidence\ntouches on one or none of these considerations.\n\nThe Government\u2019s reliance on firearm storage laws is a\nhelpful example.  These laws penalized the improper stor-\nage of firearms with forfeiture of those weapons.  See, e.g.,\nAct of Mar. 1, 1783, ch. 46, 1782 Mass. Acts pp. 119\u2013120.\nFirst, these storage laws did not impose a \u201ccomparable bur-\nden\u201d to that of \u00a7922(g)(8).  Forfeiture still allows a person to\nkeep their other firearms or obtain additional ones.  It is in\nno  way  equivalent  to  \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s  complete  prohibition  on\nowning or possessing any firearms.\n\nIn fact, the Court already reached a similar conclusion in\nHeller.  The Court was tasked with comparing laws impos-\ning \u201ca small fine and forfeiture of the weapon\u201d with the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia\u2019s ban on keeping functional handguns at\nhome  for  self-defense,  which  was  punishable  by  a  year  in\nprison.  554 U. S., at 633\u2013634.  We explained that the for-\nfeiture laws were \u201cakin to modern penalties for minor pub-\nlic-safety  infractions  like  speeding  or  jaywalking.\u201d    Id.,  at\n633.  Such  inconsequential  punishment  would  not  have\n\u201cprevented a person in the founding era from using a gun\nto protect himself or his family.\u201d  Id., at 634.  Accordingly,\nwe concluded that the burdens were not equivalent.  See id.,\nat 633\u2013634.  That analysis applies here in full force.  If a\nsmall fine and forfeiture is not equivalent to the District of\nColumbia\u2019s  handgun  ban,  it  certainly  falls  short  of\n\u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s ban on possessing any firearm.\n\nThe Government resists the conclusion that forfeiture is\nless burdensome than a possession ban, arguing that \u201c[t]he\nburdens imposed by bans on keeping, bearing, and obtain-\ning arms are all comparable.\u201d  Reply Brief 10.  But, there is\nsurely a distinction between having no Second Amendment\nrights and having some Second Amendment rights.  If self-\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n15\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndefense  is  \u201cthe  central  component  of  the  [Second  Amend-\nment]  right,\u201d  then  common  sense  dictates  that  it  matters\nwhether you can defend yourself with a firearm anywhere,\nonly at home, or nowhere.  Heller, 554 U. S., at 599 (empha-\nsis deleted).  And, the Government\u2019s suggestion ignores that\nwe have repeatedly drawn careful distinctions between var-\nious  laws\u2019  burdens.  See,  e.g.,  id.,  at  632  (explaining  that\nlaws  that  \u201cdid  not  clearly  prohibit  loaded  weapons  . . .  do\nnot remotely burden the right of self-defense as much as an\nabsolute ban on handguns\u201d); see also Bruen, 597 U. S., at\n48.\n\nOur  careful  parsing  of  regulatory  burdens  makes  sense\ngiven that  the Second  Amendment codifies a right  with  a\n\u201chistorically fixed meaning.\u201d  Id., at 28.  Accordingly, his-\ntory is our reference point and anchor.  If we stray too far\nfrom  it  by  eliding  material  differences  between  historical\nand modern laws, we \u201crisk endorsing outliers that our an-\ncestors would never have accepted.\u201d  Id., at 30 (internal quo-\ntation marks and alteration omitted).\n\nSecond, the Government offers no \u201ccomparable justifica-\ntion\u201d between laws punishing firearm storage practices and\n\u00a7922(g)(8).  It posits that both laws punish persons whose\n\u201cconduct suggested that he would not use [firearms] respon-\nsibly.\u201d  Brief for United States 24.  The Government, how-\never, does not even attempt to ground that justification in\nhistorical evidence.  See infra, at 28\u201329.\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  proposed  justification  is  also  far  too\ngeneral.  Nearly all firearm regulations can be cast as pre-\nventing  \u201cirresponsible\u201d  or  \u201cunfit\u201d  persons  from  accessing\nfirearms.  In addition, to argue that a law limiting access to\nfirearms is justified by the fact that the regulated groups\nshould  not  have  access  to  firearms  is  a  logical  merry-go-\nround.  As  the  Court  has  made  clear,  such  overly  broad\njudgments cannot suffice.  In Bruen, New York claimed it\ncould  effectively  ban  public  carry  because  \u201cthe  island  of\nManhattan [is] a \u2018sensitive place.\u2019 \u201d  597 U. S., at 31.  New\n\n\f16\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nYork defined a \u201csensitive place\u201d as \u201call places where people\ntypically congregate and where law-enforcement and other\npublic-safety  professionals  are  presumptively  available.\u201d\nId.,  at  30\u201331  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    The\nCourt  rejected  that  definition  as  \u201cfar  too  broa[d]\u201d  as  it\n\u201cwould in effect exempt cities from the Second Amendment\nand  would  eviscerate  the  general  right  to  publicly  carry\narms for self-defense.\u201d  Id., at 31.  Likewise, calling a mod-\nern  and  historical  law  comparably  justified  because  they\nboth prevent unfit persons from accessing firearms would\nrender our comparable-justification inquiry toothless.5\n\nIn sum, the Government has not identified any historical\n\nregulation that is relevantly similar to \u00a7922(g)(8).\n\n2\n\nThis  dearth  of  evidence  is  unsurprising  because  the\nFounders  responded  to  the  societal  problem  of  interper-\nsonal  violence  through  a  less  burdensome  regime:  surety\nlaws.  Tracing  back  to  early  English  history,  surety  laws\nwere  a  preventative  mechanism  for  ensuring  an  individ-\nual\u2019s future peaceable conduct.  See D. Feldman, The King\u2019s\nPeace,  the  Royal  Prerogative  and  Public  Order,  47  Cam-\nbridge L. J. 101, 101\u2013102 (1988); M. Dalton, The Countrey\nJustice  140\u2013144  (1619).    If  someone  received  a  surety  de-\nmand,  he  was  required  to  go  to  a  court  or  judicial  officer\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5 The Government\u2019s other analogies suffer from the same flaws as the\nfirearm storage laws.  It cites laws restricting firearm sales to and public\ncarry  by  various  groups  such  as  minors  and  intoxicated  persons;  laws\nconfiscating firearms from rioters; and laws disarming insurrectionists\nand rebels.  Brief for United States 22\u201327.  These laws target different\ngroups of citizens, for different reasons, and through different, less oner-\nous burdens than \u00a7922(g)(8).  See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 70 (explaining that\nregulations  \u201climit[ing]  the  intent  for  which  one  could  carry  arms,  the\nmanner by which one carried arms, or the exceptional circumstances un-\nder which one could not carry arms\u201d do not justify \u201cbroadly prohibit[ing]\nthe public carry of commonly used firearms for personal defense\u201d).

The right to demand sureties in cases of potential\ndomestic violence was recognized not only by treatises, but\nalso the founding-era courts.  Records from before and after\nthe  Second  Amendment\u2019s  ratification  reflect  that  spouses\n\n\f18\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsuccessfully demanded sureties when they feared future do-\nmestic violence.

Critically, a surety demand did not alter an individ-\nual\u2019s right to keep and bear arms.  After providing sureties,\na person kept possession of all his firearms; could purchase\nadditional firearms; and could carry firearms in public and\nprivate.  Even  if  he  breached  the  peace,  the  only  penalty\nwas that he and his sureties had to pay a sum of money.  4\nBlackstone  250.  To  disarm  him,  the  Government  would\nhave to take some other action, such as imprisoning him for\na crime.  See Feldman, 47 Cambridge L. J., at 101.\n\nBy contrast, \u00a7922(g)(8) strips an individual of his Second\nAmendment  right.    The  statute\u2019s  breadth  cannot  be  over-\nstated.  For one, \u00a7922(g) criminalizes nearly all conduct re-\nlated  to  covered  firearms  and  ammunition.    Most  funda-\nmentally,  possession  is  prohibited,  except  in  the  rarest  of\ncircumstances.  See, e.g., United States v. Rozier, 598 F. 3d\n768, 771 (CA11 2010) (per curiam) (concluding that it was\n\u201cirrelevant\u201d whether defendant \u201cpossessed the handgun for\npurposes  of  self-defense  (in  his  home)\u201d);  United  States  v.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U.

Courts  of  Appeals  have  understood  \u201cpossession\u201d\nbroadly, upholding convictions where a person \u201cpicked up\n. . . three firearms for a few seconds to inspect\u201d each, United\nStates v. Matthews, 520 F. 3d 806, 807 (CA7 2008), or \u201cmade\ndirect  contact  with  the  firearm  by  sitting  on  it,\u201d  United\nStates v. Johnson, 46 F. 4th 1183, 1189 (CA10 2022).  They\nhave also construed \u00a7922(g) to bar \u201cconstructive possession\u201d\nof a firearm, including, for example, ammunition found in a\njointly occupied home.  See, e.g., United States v. Stepp, 89\nF. 4th 826, 832\u2013835 (CA10 2023).\n\nMoreover,  \u00a7922(g)  captures  virtually  all  commercially\navailable firearms and ammunition.  It prohibits possessing\na  firearm  \u201cin  or  affecting  commerce\u201d  and  \u201creceiv[ing]  any\nfirearm  or  ammunition  which  has  been  shipped  or  trans-\nported  in  interstate  or  foreign  commerce.\u201d    \u00a7922(g).  As\ncourts have interpreted that nexus, if a firearm or ammu-\nnition has at any point crossed interstate lines, it is regu-\nlated  by  \u00a7922(g).  See  Scarborough  v.  United  States,  431\nU. S.  563,  566\u2013567  (1977)  (holding  \u00a7922(g)\u2019s  predecessor\nstatute covered firearm that \u201chad previously traveled in in-\nterstate  commerce\u201d);  United  States  v.

See Cutter v. Wil-\nkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a court of review, not of\nfirst  view\u201d).  That  said,  I  doubt  that  \u00a7922(g)(8)  is  a  proper  exercise  of\nCongress\u2019s  power  under  the  Commerce  Clause.  See  United  States  v.\nLopez, 514 U.

See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7921(a)(17)(A).\n\nThese sweeping prohibitions are criminally enforced.  To\nviolate the statute is a felony, punishable by up to 15 years.\n\u00a7924(a)(8).  That felony conviction, in turn, triggers a per-\nmanent,  life-long  prohibition  on  exercising  the  Second\nAmendment right.  See \u00a7922(g)(1).\n\nThe  combination  of  the  Government\u2019s  sweeping  view  of\nthe  firearms  and  ammunition  within  its  regulatory  reach\nand the broad prohibition on any conduct regarding covered\nfirearms  and  ammunition  makes  \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s  burden  un-\nmistakable: The statute revokes a citizen\u2019s Second Amend-\nment right while the civil restraining order is in place.  And,\nthat  revocation  is  absolute.    It  makes  no  difference  if  the\ncovered  individual  agrees  to  a  no-contact  order,  posts  a\nbond, or even moves across the country from his former do-\nmestic partner\u2014the bar on exercising the Second Amend-\nment right remains.  See United States v. Wilkey, 2020 WL\n4464668, *1 (D Mont., Aug. 4, 2020) (defendant agreed to\nFlorida protection order so he could \u201c \u2018just walk away\u2019 \u201d and\nwas prosecuted several years later for possessing firearms\nin Montana).\n\nThat combination of burdens places \u00a7922(g)(8) in an en-\ntirely different stratum from surety laws.  Surety laws pre-\nserve  the  Second  Amendment  right,  whereas  \u00a7922(g)(8)\nstrips an individual of that right.  While a breach of a surety\ndemand was punishable by a fine, \u00a7922(g)(8) is punishable\nby a felony conviction, which in turn permanently revokes\nan individual\u2019s Second Amendment right.  At base, it is dif-\nficult  to  imagine  how  surety  laws  can  be  considered  rele-\nvantly similar to a complete ban on firearm ownership, pos-\nsession, and use.\n\nThis observation is nothing new; the Court has already\nrecognized that surety laws impose a lesser relative burden\non the Second Amendment right.  In Bruen, the Court ex-\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n21\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nplained  that  surety  laws  merely  \u201cprovide  financial  incen-\ntives for responsible arms carrying.\u201d  597 U. S., at 59.  \u201c[A]n\naccused arms-bearer \u2018could go on carrying without criminal\npenalty\u2019  so  long  as  he  \u2018post[ed]  money  that  would  be  for-\nfeited if he breached the peace or injured others.\u2019 \u201d  Id., at\n56\u201357  (quoting  Wrenn  v.  District  of  Columbia,  864  F. 3d\n650, 661 (CADC 2017); alteration in original).  As a result,\nwe held that surety laws were not analogous to New York\u2019s\neffective ban on public carry.  597 U. S., at 55.  That conclu-\nsion  is  damning  for  \u00a7922(g)(8),  which  burdens  the  Second\nAmendment right even more with respect to covered indi-\nviduals.\n\nSurety laws demonstrate that this case should have been\na  \u201cstraightforward\u201d  inquiry.    Id.,  at  27.    The  Government\nfailed to produce a single historical regulation that is rele-\nvantly similar to \u00a7922(g)(8).  Rather, \u00a7922(g)(8) addresses a\nsocietal problem\u2014the risk of interpersonal violence\u2014\u201cthat\nhas  persisted  since  the  18th  century,\u201d  yet  was  addressed\n\u201cthrough [the] materially different means\u201d of  surety laws.\nId., at 26.\n\nC\n\nThe  Court  has  two  rejoinders,  surety  and  affray  laws.\nNeither is a compelling historical analogue.  As I have ex-\nplained, surety laws did not impose a burden comparable to\n\u00a7922(g)(8).  And, affray laws had a dissimilar burden and\njustification.  The  Court  does  not  reckon  with  these  vital\ndifferences,  asserting  that  the  disagreement  is  whether\nsurety and affray laws must be an exact copy of \u00a7922(g)(8).\nAnte, at 16.  But, the historical evidence shows that those\nlaws are worlds\u2014not degrees\u2014apart from \u00a7922(g)(8).  For\nthis  reason,  the  Court\u2019s  argument  requires  combining  as-\npects of surety and affray laws to justify \u00a7922(g)(8).  This\npiecemeal approach is not what the Second Amendment or\nour precedents countenance.\n\n\f22\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n1\nDespite  the  foregoing  evidence,  the  Court  insists  that\nsurety laws in fact support \u00a7922(g)(8).  To make its case, the\nCourt  studiously  avoids  discussing  the  full  extent  of\n\u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s burden as compared to surety laws.  The most\nthe Court does is attack Bruen\u2019s conclusion that surety laws\nwere less burdensome than a public carry ban.  The Court\nreasons that Bruen dealt with a \u201cbroad prohibitory regime\u201d\nwhile \u00a7922(g)(8) applies to only a subset of citizens.  Ante,\nat 15\u201316.  Yet, that was only one way in which Bruen dis-\ntinguished  a  public  carry  ban  from  surety  laws\u2019  burden.\nTrue, Bruen noted that, unlike the public carry ban, surety\nlaws did not restrict the general citizenry.  But, Bruen also\nplainly held that surety laws did not \u201cconstitut[e] a \u2018severe\u2019\nrestraint on public carry, let alone a restriction tantamount\nto a ban.\u201d  597 U. S., at 59.  In fact, that conclusion is re-\npeated throughout the opinion.  Id., at 55\u201359 (surety laws\n\u201cwere not bans on public carry\u201d; \u201csurety laws did not pro-\nhibit  public  carry\u201d;  surety  laws  \u201cwere  not  viewed  as  sub-\nstantial restrictions on public carry\u201d; and \u201csurety statutes\ndid not directly restrict public carry\u201d).  Bruen\u2019s conclusion\nis  inescapable  and  correct.  Because  surety  laws  are  not\nequivalent to an effective ban on public carry, they do not\nimpose a burden equivalent to a complete ban on carrying\nand possessing firearms.\n\nNext, the Court relies on affray laws prohibiting \u201criding\nor  going  armed,  with  dangerous  or  unusual  weapons,  [to]\nterrif[y] the good people of the land.\u201d  4 Blackstone 149 (em-\nphasis deleted).  These laws do not justify \u00a7922(g)(8) either.\nAs the Court concedes, why and how a historical regulation\nburdened the right of armed self-defense are central consid-\nerations.  Ante, at 7.  Affray laws are not a fit on either ba-\nsis.\n\nFirst,  affray  laws  had  a  distinct  justification  from\n\u00a7922(g)(8) because they regulated only certain public con-\nduct that injured the entire community.  An affray was a\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n23\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201ccommon  Nusanc[e],\u201d  1  Hawkins,  Pleas  of  the  Crown,  at\n135, defined as \u201cthe fighting of two or more persons in some\npublic place, to the terror of his majesty\u2019s subjects,\u201d 4 Black-\nstone 145.  Even though an affray generally required \u201cac-\ntual  violence,\u201d  certain  other  conduct  could  suffice.  1  R.\nBurn, The Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer 13 (2d\ned. 1756).  As relevant here, an affray included arming one-\nself \u201cwith dangerous and unusual weapons, in such a man-\nner as [to] naturally cause a terror to the people\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201cgo-\ning  armed.\u201d  Ibid.  Many  postfounding  going  armed  laws\nhad a self-defense exception: A person could \u201cgo armed with\na[n] . . . offensive and dangerous weapon\u201d so long as he had\n\u201creasonable cause to fear an assault or other injury.\u201d  Mass.\nRev. Stat., ch. 134, \u00a716 (1836); see also 1838 Terr. of Wis.\nStat.  \u00a716,  p.  381;  1851  Terr.  of  Minn.  Rev.  Stat.,  ch.  112,\n\u00a718.\n\nAffrays  were  defined  by  their  public  nature  and  effect.\nAn affray could occur only in \u201csome public place,\u201d and cap-\ntured  only  conduct  affecting  the  broader  public.    4  Black-\nstone 145.  To that end, going armed laws did not prohibit\ncarrying firearms at home or even public carry generally.\nSee Bruen, 597 U. S., at 47\u201350.  Instead, they targeted only\npublic  carry  that  was  \u201caccompanied  with  such  circum-\nstances as are apt to terrify the people.\u201d  1 Burn, Justice of\nthe Peace, at 13; see Bruen, 597 U. S., at 50 (explaining that\ngoing  armed  laws  \u201cprohibit  bearing  arms  in  a  way  that\nspreads \u2018fear\u2019 or \u2018terror\u2019 among the people\u201d).\n\nAffrays  were  intentionally  distinguished  from  assaults\nand private interpersonal violence on that same basis.  See\nCash  v.  State,  2  Tenn.  198,  199  (1813)  (\u201cIt  is  because  the\nviolence is committed in a public place, and to the terror of\nthe people, that the crime is called an affray, instead of as-\nsault and battery\u201d); Nottingham v. State, 227 Md. App. 592,\n602, 135 A. 3d 541, 547 (Md. 2016) (\u201c[U]nlike assault and\nbattery,\u201d affray is \u201cnot a crime against the person; rather,\naffray  is  a  crime  against  the  public\u201d  (internal  quotation\n\n\f24\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmarks omitted)).  As treatises shortly before the founding\nexplain, \u201cthere may be an Assault which will not amount to\nan Affray; as where it happens in a private Place, out of the\nhearing or seeing of any, except the Parties concerned; in\nwhich Case it cannot be said to be to the Terror of the Peo-\nple.\u201d  1 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, at 134; see 1 Burn,\nJustice of the Peace, at 13.  Affrays thus did not cover the\nvery conduct \u00a7922(g)(8) seeks to prevent\u2014interpersonal vi-\nolence in the home.\n\nSecond, affray laws did not impose a burden analogous to\n\u00a7922(g)(8).  They  regulated  a  niche  subset  of  Second\nAmendment-protected  activity.    As  explained,  affray  laws\nprohibited only carrying certain weapons (\u201cdangerous and\nunusual\u201d) in a particular manner (\u201cterrifying the good peo-\nple of the land\u201d without a need for self-defense) and in par-\nticular places (in public).  Meanwhile, \u00a7922(g)(8) prevents a\ncovered person from carrying any firearm or ammunition,\nin any manner, in any place, at any time, and for any rea-\nson.  Section  922(g)(8)  thus  bans  all  Second  Amendment-\nprotected  activity.    Indeed,  this  Court  has  already  con-\ncluded that affray laws do not impose a burden \u201canalogous\nto the burden created by\u201d an effective ban on public carry.\nBruen, 597 U. S., at 50.  Surely, then, a law that imposes a\npublic and private ban on a covered individual cannot have\nan analogous burden either.\n\nThe Court counters that since affray laws \u201cprovided for\nimprisonment,\u201d  they\nlesser  burden  than\nimposed  a\n\u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s disarmament.  Ante, at 14.  But, that argument\nserves  only  to  highlight  another  fundamental  difference:\nAffray laws were criminal statutes that penalized past be-\nhavior, whereas \u00a7922(g)(8) is triggered by a civil restraining\norder that seeks to prevent future behavior.  Accordingly,\nan  affray\u2019s  burden  was  vastly  harder  to  impose.    To  im-\nprison a person, a State had to prove that he committed the\ncrime of affray beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Constitu-\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n25\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntion provided a bevy of protections during that process\u2014in-\ncluding  a  right  to  a  jury  trial,  counsel,  and  protections\nagainst double jeopardy.  See Amdts. 5, 6.\n\nThe  imposition  of  \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s  burden,  however,  has  far\nfewer  hurdles  to  clear.    There  is  no  requirement  that  the\naccused has actually committed a crime; instead, he need\nonly be prohibited from threatening or using force, or pose\na  \u201ccredible  threat\u201d  to  an  \u201cintimate  partner  or  child.\u201d\n\u00a7922(g)(8)(C).  Section  922(g)(8)  thus  revokes  a  person\u2019s\nSecond  Amendment  right  based  on  the  suspicion  that  he\nmay  commit  a  crime  in  the  future.    In  addition,  the  only\nprocess required before that revocation is a hearing on the\nunderlying  court  order.   \u00a7922(g)(8)(A).  During  that  civil\nhearing\u2014which is not even about \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2014a person has\nfewer  constitutional  protections  compared  to  a  criminal\nprosecution  for  affray.  Gone  are  the  Sixth  Amendment\u2019s\npanoply of rights, including the rights to confront witnesses\nand have assistance of counsel, as well as the Fifth Amend-\nment\u2019s  protection  against  double  jeopardy.    See  Turner  v.\nRogers, 564 U. S. 431, 441 (2011) (\u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment\ndoes not govern civil cases\u201d); Hudson v. United States, 522\nU. S. 93, 99 (1997) (\u201cThe [Double Jeopardy] Clause protects\nonly  against  the  imposition  of  multiple  criminal  punish-\nments for the same offense\u201d).  Civil proceedings also do not\nrequire proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and some States\neven set aside the rules of evidence, allowing parties to rely\non  hearsay.  See,  e.g.,  Wash.  Rule  Evid.  1101(c)(4)  (2024)\n(providing the state rules of evidence \u201cneed not be applied\u201d\nto applications for protection orders (boldface and capitali-\nzation deleted)); Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7527.6(i) (West\nSupp. 2024) (judge \u201cshall receive any testimony that is rel-\nevant\u201d and issue order based on clear and convincing evi-\ndence).  The differences between criminal prosecutions and\ncivil hearings are numerous and consequential.\n\nAffray  laws  are  wide  of  the  mark.    While  the  Second\nAmendment does not demand a historical twin, it requires\n\n\f26\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsomething  closer  than  affray  laws,  which  expressly  carve\nout the very conduct \u00a7922(g)(8) was designed to prevent (in-\nterpersonal  violence  in  the  home).    Nor  would  I  conclude\nthat affray  laws\u2014criminal laws regulating a  specific type\nof public carry\u2014are analogous to \u00a7922(g)(8)\u2019s use of a civil\nproceeding  to  bar  all  Second  Amendment-protected  activ-\nity.\n\n2\nThe Court recognizes that surety and affray laws on their\nown are not enough.  So it takes pieces from each to stitch\ntogether an analogue for \u00a7922(g)(8).  Ante, at 13.  Our prec-\nedents foreclose that approach.  The question before us is\nwhether a single historical law has both a comparable bur-\nden  and  justification  as  \u00a7922(g)(8),  not  whether  several\nlaws  can  be  cobbled  together  to  qualify.    As  Bruen  ex-\nplained, \u201cdetermining whether a historical regulation is a\nproper analogue for a distinctly modern firearm regulation\nrequires a determination of whether the two regulations\u201d\u2014\nthe  historical  and  modern  regulations\u2014\u201care  \u2018relevantly\nsimilar.\u2019 \u201d    597  U. S.,  at  28\u201329.    In  doing  so,  a  court  must\nconsider  whether\nthat  single  historical  regulation\n\u201cimpose[s] a comparable burden on the right of armed self-\ndefense and whether that burden is comparably justified.\u201d\nId., at 29 (emphasis added).\n\nThe  Court\u2019s  contrary  approach  of  mixing  and  matching\nhistorical  laws\u2014relying  on  one  law\u2019s  burden  and  another\nlaw\u2019s  justification\u2014defeats  the  purpose  of  a  historical  in-\nquiry altogether.  Given that imprisonment (which involved\ndisarmament) existed at the founding, the Government can\nalways  satisfy  this  newly  minted  comparable-burden  re-\nquirement.  See  ante,  at  14\u201315.  That  means  the  Govern-\nment need only find a historical law with a comparable jus-\ntification  to  validate  modern  disarmament  regimes.  As  a\nresult, historical laws fining certain behavior could justify\ncompletely disarming a person for the same behavior.  That\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n27\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nis  the  exact  sort  of  \u201cregulatory  blank  check\u201d  that  Bruen\nwarns against and the American people ratified the Second\nAmendment to preclude.  597 U. S., at 30.\n\nNeither the Court nor the Government identifies a single\nhistorical regulation with a comparable burden and justifi-\ncation  as  \u00a7922(g)(8).  Because  there  is  none,  I  would  con-\nclude  that  the  statute  is  inconsistent  with  the  Second\nAmendment.\n\nIV\n\nThe Government, for its part, tries to rewrite the Second\nAmendment to salvage its case.  It argues that the Second\nAmendment allows Congress to disarm anyone who is not\n\u201cresponsible\u201d  and  \u201claw-abiding.\u201d  Not  a  single  Member  of\nthe  Court  adopts  the  Government\u2019s  theory.  Indeed,  the\nCourt  disposes  of  it  in  half  a  page\u2014and  for  good  reason.\nAnte, at 17.  The Government\u2019s argument lacks any basis in\nour  precedents  and  would  eviscerate  the  Second  Amend-\nment altogether.\n\nA\n\nThe Government\u2019s position is a bald attempt to refashion\nthis Court\u2019s doctrine.  At the outset of this case, the Govern-\nment contended that the Court has already held the Second\nAmendment  protects  only  \u201cresponsible,  law-abiding\u201d  citi-\nzens.  Brief for United States 6, 11\u201312.  The plain text of\nthe  Second  Amendment  quashes  this  argument.  The\nAmendment recognizes \u201cthe right of the people to keep and\nbear Arms.\u201d  (Emphasis added.)  When the Constitution re-\nfers to \u201cthe people,\u201d the term \u201cunambiguously refers to all\nmembers of the political community.\u201d  Heller, 554 U. S., at\n580;  see  also  id.,  at  581  (beginning  its  analysis  with  the\nstrong \u201cpresumption that the Second Amendment right . . .\nbelongs  to  all  Americans\u201d).  The  Government\u2019s  claim  that\nthe  Court  already  held  the  Second  Amendment  protects\n\n\f28\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nonly \u201claw-abiding, responsible citizens\u201d is specious at best.7\nSee ante, at 17.\n\nAt argument, the Government invented yet another posi-\ntion.  It explained that when it used the term \u201cresponsible\u201d\nin its briefs, it really meant \u201cnot dangerous.\u201d  See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 10\u201311.  Thus, it posited that the Second Amendment\nprotects only law-abiding and non-dangerous citizens.  No\nmatter  how  many  adjectives  the  Government  swaps  out,\nthe fact remains that the Court has never adopted anything\nakin to the Government\u2019s test.  In reality, the \u201claw-abiding,\ndangerous citizen\u201d test is the Government\u2019s own creation,\ndesigned to justify every one of its existing regulations.  It\nhas no doctrinal or constitutional mooring.\n\nThe Government finally tries to cram its dangerousness\ntest into our precedents.  It argues that \u00a7922(g)(8) and its\nproffered historical laws have a shared justification of dis-\narming  dangerous  citizens.  The  Government,  however,\ndoes not draw that conclusion by examining the historical\njustification  for  each  law  cited.    Instead,  the  Government\nsimply looks\u2014from a modern vantage point\u2014at the mix of\nlaws and manufactures a possible connection between them\nall.  Yet,  our  task  is  to  \u201cassess  whether  modern  firearms\nregulations  are  consistent  with  the  Second  Amendment\u2019s\ntext and historical understanding.\u201d  Bruen, 597 U. S., at 26\n(emphasis added).  To do so, we must look at the historical\nlaw\u2019s  justification  as  articulated  during  the  relevant  time\nperiod\u2014not at modern post-hoc speculations.  See, e.g., id.,\nat 41\u201342, 48\u201349; Heller, 554 U. S., at 631\u2013632.  As I have\nexplained, a historically based study of the evidence reveals\nthat the Government\u2019s position is untenable.  Supra, at 7\u2013\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n7 The only conceivably relevant language in our precedents is the pass-\ning reference in Heller to laws banning felons and others from possessing\nfirearms.  See 554 U. S., at 626\u2013627, and n. 26.  That discussion is dicta.\nAs for Bruen, the Court used the phrase \u201cordinary, law-abiding citizens\u201d\nmerely to describe those who were unable to publicly carry a firearm in\nNew York.  See, e.g., 597 U. S., at 9, 15, 31\u201332, 71.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n29\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n13.\n\nAs it does today, the Court should continue to rebuff the\nGovernment\u2019s attempts to rewrite the Second Amendment\nand the Court\u2019s precedents interpreting it.\n\nB\nThe Government\u2019s \u201claw-abiding, dangerous citizen\u201d the-\nory is also antithetical to our constitutional structure.  At\nbottom, its test stems from the idea that the Second Amend-\nment  points  to  general  principles,  not  a  historically\ngrounded  right.  And,  it  asserts  that  one  of  those  general\nprinciples  is  that  Congress  can  disarm  anyone  it  deems\n\u201cdangerous,  irresponsible,  or  otherwise  unfit  to  possess\narms.\u201d  Brief for United States 7.  This approach is wrong\nas a matter of constitutional interpretation, and it under-\nmines the very purpose and function of the Second Amend-\nment.\n\nThe  Second  Amendment  recognizes  a  pre-existing  right\nand that right was \u201censhrined with the scope\u201d it was \u201cun-\nderstood  to  have  when  the  people  adopted  [the  Amend-\nment].\u201d  Heller, 554 U. S., at 634\u2013635.  Only a subsequent\nconstitutional  amendment  can  alter  the  Second  Amend-\nment\u2019s  terms,  \u201cwhether  or  not  future  legislatures  or  . . .\neven future judges think [its original] scope [is] too broad.\u201d\nId., at 635.\n\nYet,  the  Government\u2019s  \u201claw-abiding,  dangerous  citizen\u201d\ntest\u2014and  indeed  any  similar,  principle-based  approach\u2014\nwould hollow out the Second Amendment of any substance.\nCongress could impose any firearm regulation so long as it\ntargets \u201cunfit\u201d persons.  And, of course, Congress would also\ndictate  what  \u201cunfit\u201d  means  and  who  qualifies.    See  Tr.  of\nOral Arg. 7, 51.  The historical understanding of the Second\nAmendment right would be irrelevant.  In fact, the Govern-\nment  posits  that  Congress  could  enact  a  law  that  the\nFounders explicitly rejected.  See id., at 18 (agreeing that\n\n\f30\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmodern judgment would override \u201c[f]ounding-[e]ra applica-\ntions\u201d).  At base, whether a person could keep, bear, or even\npossess  firearms  would  be  Congress\u2019s  policy  choice  under\nthe Government\u2019s test.\n\nThat would be the direct inverse of the Founders\u2019 and rat-\nifying public\u2019s intent.  Instead of a substantive right guar-\nanteed to every individual against Congress, we would have\na right controlled by Congress.  \u201cA constitutional guarantee\nsubject to future judges\u2019 [or Congresses\u2019] assessments of its\nusefulness  is  no  constitutional  guarantee  at  all.\u201d    Heller,\n554  U. S.,  at  634.  The  Second  Amendment  is  \u201cthe  very\nproduct of an interest balancing by the people.\u201d  Id., at 635.\nIt is this policy judgment\u2014not that of modern and future\nCongresses\u2014\u201cthat  demands  our  unqualified  deference.\u201d\nBruen, 597 U. S., at 26.\n\nThe Government\u2019s own evidence exemplifies the dangers\nof approaches based on generalized principles.  Before the\nCourt of Appeals, the Government pointed to colonial stat-\nutes \u201cdisarming classes of people deemed to be threats, in-\ncluding . . . slaves, and native Americans.\u201d  Supp. Brief for\nUnited States in No. 21\u201311001 (CA5), p. 33.  It argued that\nsince  early  legislatures  disarmed  groups  considered  to  be\n\u201cthreats,\u201d a modern Congress has the same authority.  Ibid.\nThe problem with such a view should be obvious.  Far from\nan exemplar of Congress\u2019s authority, the discriminatory re-\ngimes  the  Government  relied  upon  are  cautionary  tales.\nThey warn that when majoritarian interests alone dictate\nwho is \u201cdangerous,\u201d and thus can be disarmed, disfavored\ngroups become easy prey.  One of many such examples was\nthe  treatment  of  freed  blacks  following  the  Civil  War.\n\u201c[M]any of the over 180,000 African-Americans who served\nin the Union Army returned to the States of the old Confed-\neracy, where systematic efforts were made to disarm them\nand other blacks.\u201d  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 771\nformally  prohibited  African-\n(2010).\n  And,\nAmericans  from  possessing  firearms.\u201d\n\nSome  \u201cStates\n\n  Ibid.\n\n\fCite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)\n\n31\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201c[t]hroughout  the  South,  armed  parties  . . .  forcibly  took\nfirearms  from  newly  freed  slaves.\u201d  Id.,  at  772.  \u201cIn  one\ntown, the marshal took all arms from returned colored sol-\ndiers, and was very prompt in shooting the blacks whenever\nan  opportunity  occurred.\u201d    Ibid.  (alterations  and  internal\nquotation  marks  omitted).    A  constitutional  amendment\nwas ultimately \u201cnecessary to provide full protection for the\nrights of blacks.\u201d  Id., at 775.\n\nThe Government peddles a modern version of the govern-\nmental authority that led to those historical evils.  Its the-\nory would allow federal majoritarian interests to determine\nwho  can  and  cannot  exercise  their  constitutional  rights.\nWhile Congress cannot revive disarmament laws based on\nrace, one can easily imagine a world where political minor-\nities or those with disfavored cultural views are deemed the\nnext \u201cdangers\u201d to society.  Thankfully, the Constitution pro-\nhibits  such  laws.  The  \u201cvery  enumeration  of  the  [Second\nAmendment] right takes out of the hands of government . . .\nthe  power  to  decide  on  a  case-by-case  basis  whether  the\nright is really worth insisting upon.\u201d  Heller, 544 U. S., at\n634.\n\nThe Court rightly rejects the Government\u2019s approach by\nconcluding that any modern regulation must be justified by\nspecific historical regulations.  See ante, at 10\u201315.  But, the\nCourt should remain wary of any theory in the future that\nwould exchange the Second Amendment\u2019s boundary line\u2014\n\u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed\u201d\u2014for  vague  (and  dubious)  principles  with  con-\ntours defined by whoever happens to be in power.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\nThis case is not about whether States can disarm people\nwho threaten others.  States have a ready mechanism for\ndisarming anyone who uses a firearm to threaten physical\nviolence:  criminal  prosecution.  Most  States,  including\nTexas, classify aggravated assault as a felony, punishable\n\n\f32\n\nUNITED STATES v. RAHIMI\n\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nby up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.  See Tex. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a722.02(b), 12.33 (West 2019 and Supp. 2023).  Assuming\nC. M.\u2019s allegations could be proved, Texas could have con-\nvicted and imprisoned Rahimi for every one of his alleged\nacts.  Thus, the question before us is not whether Rahimi\nand  others  like  him  can  be  disarmed  consistent  with  the\nSecond Amendment.  Instead, the question is whether the\nGovernment can strip the Second Amendment right of any-\none subject to a protective order\u2014even if he has never been\naccused or convicted of a crime.  It cannot.  The Court and\nGovernment do not point to a single historical law revoking\na citizen\u2019s Second Amendment  right based on possible in-\nterpersonal  violence.  The  Government  has  not  borne  its\nburden to prove that \u00a7922(g)(8) is consistent with the Sec-\nond Amendment\u2019s text and historical understanding.\n\nThe  Framers  and  ratifying  public  understood  \u201cthat  the\nright to keep and bear arms was essential to the preserva-\ntion of liberty.\u201d  McDonald, 561 U. S., at 858 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Yet, in the\ninterest of ensuring the Government can regulate one sub-\nset  of  society,  today\u2019s  decision  puts  at  risk  the  Second\nAmendment rights of many more.  I respectfully dissent.\n\n",
